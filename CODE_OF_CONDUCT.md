# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

## Our Standards

- Please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might
  detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
- Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
  implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom
  a right answer.
- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you
  want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
  That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term "harassment" as including
  the definition in the
  [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/). If you have any
  lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read
  their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes
  people in socially marginalized groups.
- Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel
  you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community
  member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the TC members
  immediately with a capture (log, photo, email) of the harassment if possible.
  Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this
  community a safe place for you and we've got your back.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
  behavior is not welcome.
- Avoid the use of personal pronouns in code comments or documentation. There is
  no need to address persons when explaining code (e.g. "When the developer")

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

## Moderation

Remarks that violate the standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful,
oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but
never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.) Remarks that
moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are
also not allowed. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
If the warning is unheeded, the user will be “kicked,” i.e., kicked out of the
communication channel to cool off. If the user comes back and continues to make
trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded. Moderators may choose
at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer
the offended party a genuine apology. If a moderator bans someone and you think
it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different
moderator, in private. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a
moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway
than others.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be
defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even
if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there
was something you could’ve communicated better — remember that it’s your
responsibility to make your fellow contributers comfortable. Everyone wants to
get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about
cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent
and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at committee@redbrick.dcu.ie. The
project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a
way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

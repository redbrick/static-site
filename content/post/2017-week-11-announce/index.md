## Building a Desktop

Want to learn about building desktops? Are you not sure of how different
individual components work inside your machine? Do you need help fixing your PC?
Just need some buyers tips in general?

At some time or another we all venture into the world of building and on
Wednesday the 29th at 15:00 a Redbrick member by the username of mikello will be
giving a great talk, introducing you to the world of desktop building.

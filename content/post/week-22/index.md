title: Week 22 - New Committee | Birthday
---

Hi all:

We’ve had a busy week with a talk, quiz and the AGM. Last week was the AGM or
the shuffling of Committee, when we say good bye to some old faces and hello to
some new ones. As those of you who attended the AGM know, I was appointed as
Redbrick’s new and shiny secretary, I look forward to a year writing badly
worded but informing announces for my adoring public. Now down to business…

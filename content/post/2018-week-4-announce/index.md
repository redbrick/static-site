## Intro To Linux

Meet your new home! The surroundings of Linux can be quite intimidating at
first, once you open up a terminal like your lecturer told you to, it feels as
if you're abstracted away form this new environment! Sure, you can `cd` & `ls`
your way around the terminal for the next while, but eventually, you're going to
need a bit more than that.

On Wednesday you'll receive a brief Intro to Linux courtesy of Redbrick's very
own Helpdesk! We will be (hopefully) covering something new for everyone here!!
Make sure you come along to LG25 on Wednesday at 15:00 to learn you some Linux
and eat you some pizza !

too afraid to ask questions? Never fear! HackerClub is back and better than
ever!

Come along down to L101 Thursday at 4pm to find out what it’s all about and

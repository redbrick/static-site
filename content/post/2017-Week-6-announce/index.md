## Linux Installfest

### Wednesday 25/10/2017 | 5pm | LG26

What's this Linux thing all the cool kids are talking about? _Why should you
care?_ Come on down to LG26 this Wednesday, where we'll give you the low-down on
the world's most widely used operating system!

There'll be a quick overview of what Linux is & what is has to offer, followed
by a hands-on tutorial where you'll install your very own Linux system, either
on a Virtual Machine, or your own laptop.

This may sound like an intimidating event, but we're committed to making our
talks accessible to everyone! People of all skill levels are more than welcome,
and we'll be ensuring everyone's up to speed before we move on to anything new.

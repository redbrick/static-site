Hello my lovelies,

Because Redbrick is _so great_, and because I am _so inefficient_, there are
even more events in the near future that I didn't mention in the earlier email!
Whooo!

 <!-- more -->

## Web Design with MPS

- Date: Tuesday 08/03 (tomorrow!)
- Time: 5pm - 6pm
- Location: C102

Our friends in the Media Production Society are joining us to learn about
building websites and making moolah. Our very own Aaron (~devoxel) will be
looking at the basics of HTML and CSS and making new media-producing friends in
the shiny Mac labs in the Henry Grattan, with plans to continue tainting them
with web development knowledge next week too. Pop over if you want to learn how
to make a sexy site, hug a sexy committee member, or just have some fun!

If you have anything in particular you want Aaron to talk about, send an
all-caps email to devoxel at redbrick.dcu.ie.

## Irish Collegiate Programming Contest (IrlCPC)

- Date: Saturday 02/04
- Time: 9.30am - 6.30pm
- Location: University College Cork
- More info: http://acm.ucc.ie/irlcpc

If you want to take your programming to the next level, then this is the event
for you. The IrlCPC is a programming competition hosted by the UCC ACM Student
Chapter, and is the place to be to meet the who's who of the Irish programming
red carpet. Teams of 3 ready for the event need to register before the 16th of
March.

Redbrick will be sending a contingent, and will be paying some of the costs
involved! The extent of the funding will depend on numbers; if you're interested
in competing, then email your friendly neighbourhood Redbrick committee. There
are limited spaces however, so get your name in quick if you want to show off
your sick programming skillz!

Don't forget to hurriedly write a second announce email and check out our
calendar and social media pages:

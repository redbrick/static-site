## IoT Security Talk with d_fens

IoT, short for the Internet of Things, simply put, this is the connecting any
smart device to the Internet, but smart devices can range from your phone to
your fridge to your car these days.

IoT security has been brought further up the stack of issues that need to be
addressed due to the wide variety of frightening vulnerabilities some of these
devices possess.

Make sure to come along to LG25 on Wednesday the 15th of November at 16:00 as an
associate of ours, by the username of d_fens, is coming in to tell us about the
world of IoT, IoT security, and some of the more odd and interesting
vulnerabilities found over the years.

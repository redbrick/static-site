Redbrick in association with the [Student's Union](http://www.dcusu.ie/) are
extremely proud to host the first annual Digital Discovery Week in DCU. The idea
of Digital Discovery Week is to show how computing is everywhere in our day to
day lives and to engage those of us that are quite technical as well as those
that may not be studying computing.

We have a whole week jam packed full of events that are aimed at everybody in
DCU and we encourage everyone, not just Redbrick members, to come along to any
event and learn something new.

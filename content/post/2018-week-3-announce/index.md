## Microsoft Talk - Why (almost) everything is worse at Scale. And why that’s Good

To solve problems that affect billions of people, you need to think about them
in a different way. This talk will follow how we use the scale of Microsoft to
empower the lives of all of our users, including how the scale affects how we go
about solving issues, testing for it and how we monitor for issues.

Eoin O'Brien has been a software engineer in Microsoft Office for over 2 years
currently driving knowledge from insights on the One Microsoft Enterprise
Acceleration team. Eoin has worked on services, data processing and publicly
facing websites, including working on both the consumer and enterprise side of
Office, driving growth and adoption. Come along and see what this great talk has
to offer, meet some great industry professionals and maybe learn something new!

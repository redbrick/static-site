## Interpints

This coming Friday (16th of February) is Interpints! Interpints is a somewhat
cool name for a bunch of the networking societies around the city getting
together and mingling to their herts content over a few drinks.

Everyone is welcome to come, it's always fun to meet new like-minded people and
an inter-society event is the perfect place to do it!

Societies present at interpints: Redbrick, DU Netsoc, DIT CompSoc, and DUCSS.

We hope to meet up in Alfie Byrne's at around 7:00pm on Friday.

See you then!

## Automate & Chill

No plans for Valentine's Day yet? Rather eat pizza and find out how to make your
life a little less hectic? Well then LG26 is where you need to be at 15:00 on
Wednesday the 14th my friend!

Over the past few months, some of the current Redbrick committee members have
found ways to automate certain aspects of their roles. On Wednesday we look at
what they've done and how you can apply it to your own jobs.

No one likes having to do the same thing over and over again, so come along to
LG26 on Wednesday at 15:00 and start eliminating the tedious day-to-day tasks
from your life!

## HackerClub

Finding programming hard? At a point where you are too afraid to ask for help?

Never fear - HackerClub is here!

Come along to L101 on Tuesdays at 16:00 to improve your programming skills by
solving competitive programming problems. Practice makes perfect right?

People who attended HackerClub last semester improved more and more with each
passing week, but most of all, they became increasingly confident in their code.
HackerClub is run by people who know how chaotic it is as a newbie programmer,
so this kind of development and growth is very important to us.

Pop along to L101 at or indeed between 16:00 to 18:00 on a Tuesday this semester
Rest assured that Redbrick will be there to help out!

## B.Y.O.P

Welcome to Redbrick's brand new weekly workshop, Build Your Own Projects!
Running in L128 on Thursday from 16:00 to 18:00 this week, BYOP is a workshop
focused on project based learning, i.e applying what you already know to
projects.

Along the way you will show you some handy tools you can use to enhance and
improve your projects.

So have a brainstorm and then come on down on Thursday and pick up some new
skills as you build!

## Google Hash Code

Step into the shoes of a Google engineer during Hash Code, a team programming
competition that tasks students and professionals across Europe, the Middle East
and Africa with solving a Google engineering problem. Are you up for the
challenge? The first round (an Online Qualification Round) is on 1st March at
18:30 CET.

You can take part from anywhere you'd like, or you can participate in one of the
Hash Code hubs. DCU's School of Computing is once again a Hash Code hub,
providing a fun and exciting environment where teams compete side-by-side.

Top scoring teams from this round will be invited to Google Dublin to compete
for the title of Hash Code 2018 champion.

## IrlCPC

The 2018 Irish Collegiate Programming Competition will be held on Saturday the
10th of March in UCC. If you intend to travel down with Redbrick to IrlCPC,
please respond s soon as possible as we can give 50% off to the first seven
teams that sign up to travel with us.

If you're thinking of entering, head on over to

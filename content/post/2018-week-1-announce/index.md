Hey everyone my name's branch and I'm back as your favourite Redbrick Secretary.

It's finally here the start of another DCU year and another one full of Redbrick
fun. It's scary how quick the Summertime flies, I know there's going to be loads
on to fill your first busy week so I won't keep you long. Let's get right into
it!

TL;DR

## Clubs & Socs

Come down to see us at Clubs and Socs, We'll have a big stand set up and we'll
be there all day on Monday the 1st, Tuesday the 2nd and Wednesday the 3rd. Come
around to see us to have a chat, a slice of pizza and signup for another great
year of events and talks!

## Intro to Redbrick

What's a Redbrick and how do I use it? On the last day of Clubs & Socs on
Wednesday the 3rd from 3-4 @LG25 we will be introducing our new members to
Redbrick!

Come along and learn more about us, our community and what we can do for you!

Current members and associates are welcome to come along, if you have friends
who'd like to join, bring them along to the event if they didn't make it to C&S
days!

## Semester Two Membership

Have a friend who feels it's too late to join a society? Have a friend who wants
to get in on the Redbrick action? Well lucky for them, we are taking new
memberships, but this time around it's half price!

It's a pretty solid deal, it means you can avail of the multiple services we
provide, and all for the low, low price of â‚¬2.00. Get all your friends to sign
up. We know and you know that they are missing out.

## Google Hash Code

Step into the shoes of a Google engineer during Hash Code, a team programming
competition that tasks students and professionals across Europe, the Middle East
and Africa with solving a Google engineering problem. Are you up for the
challenge? The first round (an Online Qualification Round) is on 1st March at
18:30 CET.

You can take part from anywhere you'd like, or you can participate in one of the
Hash Code hubs. DCU's School of Computing is once again a Hash Code hub,
providing a fun and exciting environment where teams compete side-by-side.

Top scoring teams from this round will be invited to Google Dublin to compete
for the title of Hash Code 2018 champion.

## IrlCPC

The 2018 Irish Collegiate Programming Competition will be held on Saturday the
10th of March. If you intend to travel down with Redbrick to IrlCPC, please
respond s soon as possible as we can give 50% off to the first seven teams that
sign up to travel with us.

If you're thinking of entering, head on over to

## HackerClub

Last semester we saw a lot of our attending members develop as both problem
solvers and programmers because of HackerClub and we hope this semester is just
as successful!

HackerClub is back once again, but this week it's on Tuesday at 16:00 in L101.
Whether you've attended a HackerClub session before or not make sure you come
along on Tuesday at 16:00 so you can start making HackerClub a staple of your
weekly college diet in Semester Two!

## FOSDEM

Redbrick are off to FOSDEM once again. We fly out to Brussels this coming
Friday. Needless to say we are all super excited and are anticipating a great
weekend.

For our traveling members, there will be a final talk to run over all details of
our trip. This will take place at 14:00 on Wednesday in LG26. If you cannot
attend this get together on Wednesday please let us know as soon as possible so
we can organize and alternative time to talk to you individually.

## Agile & Friends

Wait you're meant to actually plan how you program? Why is waterfall bad? What
does scrum have to do with software?? Ever ask yourself these questions? Then
come along to Agile & Friends in LG26 on Wednesday at 15:00, where our friendly
helpdesk will explain why project management might actually be useful and how to
do it!

## B.Y.O.P (Build Your Own Projects)

Lastly to round the week off we have our brand new weekly project workshop -
B.Y.O.P! Running in L125 on Thursday from 14:00 to 16:00 this week, B.Y.O.P is a
workshop focused on project based learning, i.e applying what you already know
to projects. Along the way you will show you some handy tools you can use to
enhance and improve your projects.

So come on down on Thursday with a project idea. If you don't have one, don't
fret! We always come prepared with a few stock projects!

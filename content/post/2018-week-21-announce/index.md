## Google Hash Code

Step into the shoes of a Google engineer during Hash Code, a team programming
competition that tasks students and professionals across Europe, the Middle East
and Africa with solving a Google engineering problem. Are you up for the
challenge? The first round (an Online Qualification Round) is on 1st March at
18:30 CET.

You can take part from anywhere you'd like, or you can participate in one of the
Hash Code hubs. DCU's School of Computing is once again a Hash Code hub,
providing a fun and exciting environment where teams compete side-by-side.

Top scoring teams from this round will be invited to Google Dublin to compete
for the title of Hash Code 2018 champion.

## IrlCPC

The 2018 Irish Collegiate Programming Competition will be held on Saturday the
10th of March. If you intend to travel down with Redbrick to IrlCPC, please

## Reintroduction to Redbrick

Unfortunately, our previously scheduled talk for the 7th of February needs to be
reorganized for another Wednesday later this semester. But never fear, we still
have a great Wednesday talk!

As the academic year progresses, you end up with a number of people who missed
some of the more important and fundamental Redbrick talks.

This one is for all the new faces, and for those not so new faces that need a
friendly reintroduction to what Redbrick does, along with a crash course in how
to become a part of the not so elite IRC squad.

Come along to LG26 on Wednesday at 15:00 and catch up on all the action!

## B.Y.O.P (Build Your Own Projects)

Our brand new weekly workshop is back! Running in L125 on Thursday from 16:00 to
18:00 this week, B.Y.O.P is a workshop focused on project based learning, i.e
applying what you already know to projects. Along the way you will show you some
handy tools you can use to enhance and improve your projects.

So come on down on Thursday if you want to improve your software development
skill-set!

## FOSDEM

Last but not least, for all those who ate and slept regularly this weekend, and
thus as a result couldn't make it to FOSDEM, videos of some of the talks have
already been made available already at https://video.fosdem.org/2018/

Also a big shout out to the traveling members who flew back into Dublin airport
late last night. Hope you all enjoy your lectures today!

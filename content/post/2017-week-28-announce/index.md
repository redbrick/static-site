## Redbrick AGM 2017

- When: 4PM, Wednesday 5/4/2017
- Where: CG04, Henry Grattan Building
- RSVP: https://www.facebook.com/events/1357413470985789/

It's AGM time once again! The following positions will be open:

- Chair
- Secretary
- Public Relations Officer
- Events Officer
- Treasurer
- Helpdesk (x2)
- System Administrator (x3)
- Webmaster

If you wish to run for the positions of Helpdesk, SysAdmin or Webmaster, please
email committee@redbrick.dcu.ie to express your interest on or before this
Wednesday (29/3/17), as eligibility to run for these positions requires passing
an exam devised by the current holders of said position.

Exams for all 3 positions from previous years can be found [here](/help/exams/)

Additionally, we will be voting on a minor change to the Constitution, see the
proposed changes [here](https://github.com/redbrick/static-site/pull/145)

## Redbrick Table Quiz

- When: 7PM, Wednesday 5/4/2017
- Where: NuBar, DCU
- RSVP: https://www.facebook.com/events/1851910805089883/

Following the AGM, we'll be welcoming our shiny new Committee aboard at our
annual table quiz! We invite you all to eat, drink and be merry with us, and
perhaps win a few prizes in the process. Teams of no more than 4!

Not quizically-inclined? Fear not! There'll also be a raffle taking place, to
ensure everyone has a chance to win something they don't want or need!

## Linux Fundamentals

Following the success of our BASH talk, we are doing Redbrick by request this
week! You asked for it, so here's Linux Fundamentals!

Sure, you could 'cd' and 'ls' your way around the terminal for the rest of your
life, but you're going to need a bit more than that.

On Wednesday we will be talking to you about what a kernel is, the structure of
the filesystem, and your processes. We will also be diving into a lot of
important commands, covering file permissions, piping, redirection, and process
management, along with a multitude of other things!

Come along to LG26 on Wednesday at 15:00 to learn some Linux and eat some pizza
!

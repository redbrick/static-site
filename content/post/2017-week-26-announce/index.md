Dear Redbrick members,

We have a fairly packed couple of weeks coming up, here's the gist of what's
happening:

## TechWeek Day One

- When: Wednesday 15th March, 3-6pm

Our techweek has been deconstructed this year and is now being split into three
days over three weeks. The first one is this Wednesday on the topic of Security.
We've got three talks from people in industry + an opening event by the
committee. It'll be really fun and informative, hope to see you there.

## Redbrick HackerClub

Redbrick's got a hackerclub going. It's the hottest thing on campus. Know how to
program? Come program. Don't know? Come learn and chat! As long you're
interested in technology, show up and it'll be good times all round.

## irlCPC

- When: Saturday 25th March,
- Where: UCC Cork

It's that time of the year again when we take a trip to dear old Cork for
IrlCPC! For those of you who don't know it's the Irish Collegiate Programming
Competition and signups are open. The competition is on the 25th of March 2017
and signups close on March 15th. The competition is for teams of 3 people. If
you wish to join us on this trip please email commitee@redbrick.dcu.ie

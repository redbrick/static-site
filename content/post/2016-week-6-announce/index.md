Dear Redbrick pals,

As the nights are getting longer and Christmas lights begin to fill the streets
of Dublin we can safely come to the conclusion that the mean nights of latish
October have arrived.

Luckily, Redbrick has loads of cool things going on to combat your onset winter

Redbrick loves Halloween! Come celebrate it and have a few drinks with us in the
Slipper. Fancy dress is optional but I speak on behalf of the whole committee in
saying we’ll love people who dress up just a bit more than those who don’t.

Also, as referenced in our last newsletter both PyCon and UKIEPC are coming up
very shortly with the UKIEPC registration deadline being this Wednesday the 26th
October and PyCon taking place the weekend after.

On top of this, Accenture are running an event in DCU on Wednesday 1pm – 3pm
about potential careers in STEM. More info found here:

Hope y’all had a fab week and I’ll see you soon.

## Containers: How Do They Work?

Don't know your Dockers from your Rkts? Ever wondered what these 'container'
things everyone's talking about are? Join us in LG26, where we'll have Cormac
(~pints) from Demonware coming to demystify the wonderful world of process
isolation. Absolute beginners welcome! This talk assumes no prior container or
virtualisation experience, though a little Linux knowledge would help!

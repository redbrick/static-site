Dear Redbrick friends,

We're ploughing through the academic year. With 22 weeks gone, here's what's
still to come:

# Admin Talk: Setting up a Server for Fun and Profit

- When: Wednesday 15th, 3-4pm
- Where: LG26
- More information here: https://www.facebook.com/events/606208012923445/

Have you ever started your own billion dollar social network only to realise you
don't have space in your tiny bedroom for racks on racks of servers? You're not
the only one! Luckily, with a special talk from pints and zergless, you'll
finally get to figure out how to avoid an appearance on Makeover: Home Edition
and learn how to host your web-servers on other peoples' computers.

SIDE-NOTE: if you have anything you would like to hear a talk about, please let
us know! We're always into fresh new ideas.

# Google #HashCode 2017

- When: Thursday 23rd, 5-9pm
- Where: LG25
- More information here: https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/

Once again, DCU School of Computing will be a Hub for Google's HashCode
competition.

The online Qualification Round will take place in LG25 on Thursday 23rd February
5-9pm. Hash Code is open to university students and industry professionals in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Participants compete in teams of two to
four.

Registration is free of charge and will close on 20th February 2017 at 17:00
GMT.

# Hoodies

Finally, Redbrick is making hoodies! If you're interested in some
primo-nice-cool-trendy-zip-up-hoodies, fill out your interest here:
http://hoodies.redbrick.dcu.ie/ They'll cost around 35 euros and will have a
logo on the chest and the back and if you want you can get your name on the
sleeve. You have until the end of the month to register.

See you soon,

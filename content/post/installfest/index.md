title: Redbrick Linux Installfest
---

This year we were able to host our annual Installfest, thanks to the support of
Ubuntu Ireland. We offered three options for attendees, Ubuntu 12.04, OpenSuse
13.1, and Mint 15. With most of attendees choosing to install Ubuntu as a dual
boot, it was simple business from there, except for some pesky Windows 8
machines.

We were lucky enough to have CD's already from Ubuntu, along with some stickers
for people to decorate their machines should they wish. We also had UBS's of all
distros on hold on our Ubuntu lanyards.

Overall it was a great Installfest! Special thanks go to Ubuntu Ireland for
their kind donations, and Firehouse for tasty pizza.

Pictures to follow soon.

## SISTEM Website: https://sistem.redbrick.dcu.ie/

SISTEM is a meetup style conference run by students, for students. We hope
SISTEM helps provide a link between students and those in the world of tech and
enterprise in a casual meetup environment.

Redbrick DCU, DUCSS, DIT Compsoc and DU Netsoc have come together to organise
the tech event of the year! Those involved in organising SISTEM are
undergraduates, and they recognised the lack of an event in Ireland that targets
topics in a way that doesn’t leave students with heavy eyes & boggled minds.

We hope this conference helps provide a link between students and those in the
world of tech and enterprise in a casual meetup environment.

SISTEM will take place on the 24th of March 2018 at The Innovation Academy. The
conference will start at 9:00 AM and conclude around 5:00 PM that day. During
the conference, there will be speakers from an array of different companies as
well as workshops and lightning talks.

We have a very exciting list of speakers and workshops that will be announced
shortly, as will ticket sales. Tickets will be selling at €10 per person.

## Linux Fundamentals

Following the success of our BASH talk, we are doing Redbrick by request this
week! You asked for it, so here's Linux Fundamentals!

Sure, you could 'cd' and 'ls' your way around the terminal for the rest of your
life, but you're going to need a bit more than that.

On Wednesday we will be talking to you about what a kernel is, the structure of
the filesystem, and your processes. We will also be diving into a lot of
important commands, covering file permissions, piping, redirection, and process
management, along with a multitude of other things!

Come along to LG26 on Wednesday at 15:00 to learn some Linux and eat some pizza
!

Come along to L101 on Tuesdays at 16:00 to improve your programming skills by
solving competitive programming problems. Practice makes perfect, right?

## B.Y.O.P

Redbrick's weekly workshop, Build Your Own Projects is on again! Running in L128
on Thursday from 16:00 to 18:00 this week, BYOP is a workshop focused on
project-based learning, i.e applying what you already know to projects.

## Google Hash Code

Step into the shoes of a Google engineer during Hash Code, a team programming
competition that tasks students and professionals across Europe, the Middle East
and Africa with solving a Google engineering problem. Are you up for the
challenge? The first round (an Online Qualification Round) is on 1st March at
18:30 CET.

You can take part from anywhere you'd like, or you can participate in one of the
Hash Code hubs. DCU's School of Computing is once again a Hash Code hub,
providing a fun and exciting environment where teams compete side-by-side.

Top scoring teams from this round will be invited to Google Dublin to compete
for the title of Hash Code 2018 champion.

## IrlCPC

The 2018 Irish Collegiate Programming Competition will be held on Saturday the
10th of March in UCC. If you intend to travel down with Redbrick to IrlCPC,
please emailcommittee@redbrick.dcu.ie as soon as possible as we can give 50% off

## SISTEM

A big thank you to everyone who came to SISTEM! We can't wait for next year! An
even bigger thank you to all the committees involved, Redbrick, TCD Netsoc,
DUCSS and DIT CompSoc.

## Programming Easter Eggs

Sometimes programmers are bored or just want to inject a little fun into their
work! So this week we're exploring all the fun little treats and tricks in
various websites and programming languages! There will also be Easter eggs
raffled off!

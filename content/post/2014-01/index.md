title: Pygmalion - Update Tuesday 16th September
---

Hi everyone,

We'll be doing an update on Pygmalion on Tuesday 16th September 7pm.

Please be aware that the server will be available from 6:45 p.m. We estimate
this update will only take 30 mins.

We hope to have restored Pygmalion's service completely by 7:30 p.m.

Regards,

Richard Walsh (koffee)

## Tech Week Day Two

Our techweek has been deconstructed this year and is now being split into three
days over three weeks. The second one is this Wednesday on the topic of
development tools. We've got three talks from people in industry and from
current students.

## Redbrick Hackerclub

Redbrick's got a hackerclub going. It's the hottest thing on campus. Know how to
program? Come program. Don't know? Come learn and chat! As long you're
interested in technology, show up and it'll be good times all round.

## irlCPC

It's that time of the year again when we take a trip to dear old Cork for
IrlCPC! If you wish to travel and stay with us on this trip please email
commitee@redbrick.dcu.ie. It should come out to around 12 euros per person.

Finally, if you’re interested in becoming a member of the redbrick helpdesk,

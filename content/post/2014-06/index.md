Good afternoon Everyone,

First of all, we'd like to apologise for the late announce! It shouldn't happen
again! The evenings are getting shorter as we head into week 4. This week we're
filling this shortening evenings with some great events. It's all about quality,
not quantity.

Without further ado the agenda for the week is as follows:

- Screen at Redbrick
- Associate Talks
- Helpdesk Talks
- Intercom at Redbrick

 <!-- more -->

## Screen at Redbrick

We've had to postpone this as we have admin exams at 6pm. So we're going to
reschedule for next week and change up the movie to the cheesy 1995 classic
"Hackers" Sorry for the inconvenience, we'll make sure you guys get all of next
week's details sooner. We're still ironing out a few bugs on this end.

## Associate Talks: elephant

- Topic: "Spammers Hate Him! One weird trick for staying secure online"
- When: Tuesday 14th October at 18:00
- Where: C115

Social media accounts are valuable to scammers and spammers, who want to make a
quick buck off your reputation. Here?s a few tips to help make your accounts
harder to abuse so hold on to your tinfoil hats kids Diarmaid MacManus will be
talking to us about how to stay secure online, some of the tips and tricks he's
learned from his time in application security with various multinationals. If
you don't leave this talk paranoid we'll be surprised!

## Helpdesk Talks

- Topic: How to get up and running with Redbrick.

Cian Butler will be guiding you through your first steps using Redbrick
services. He'll be walking through how to use your webspace, logging into IRC
and how to run programmes on our development servers. With the rest of the
committee on hand to help out we should have you up and running in no time.

##Intercom at Redbrick This week we see another company come to pay us a visit;
this week it's Intercom. Intercom has only recently had its 3rd birthday, yet
it's making huge a serious impact on how companies deal with their customers.
Intercom have had developers, engineers and business join them from companies as
big as Amazon and Google. Come along on Thursday and see how Intercom do what
they do, and what it's like to work for them. We've got: Brian White and Brian
Long (make sure to call him Robin) coming to talk about running Intercom.
Matthew Barrington will be fanboying to the extreme about his time with
Intercom. This should be a great evening, for anyone that may have been at the
inside intercom meetings throughout the year you know how interesting and
enthusiastic the Intercomrades are; for those who haven't you should definitely
come along and witness it first hand.

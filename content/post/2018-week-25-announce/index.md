## Ancient Brain Bug Bounty

DCU Lecturer Mark Humphrys want to recruit some white hat hackers for a "bug
bounty" scheme, and he thought Redbrick would be a good place to start!

Mark will be coming in to talk to us about finding bugs and exploits in his
site, Ancient Brain. Each valid exploit or bug comes with a generous cash
reward, so come along to LG26 at 15:00 on Wednesday the 7th of March to find out
how you can help stress-test his site!

More info can be found at https://ancientbrain.com/bugs.php

## Jobs Board Survey

Here at Redbrick we sometimes hear about different jobs that might be of
interest to our members. As a committee we want to hear what our members think
about the idea of a jobs board as one of our services.

We have made a typeform survey to gather your opinions. We would really
appreciate it if you could fill it out!

## HackerClub

Come along to L101 on Tuesdays at 16:00 to improve your programming skills by
solving competitive programming problems. Practice makes perfect, right?

## HackerClub

First off, a big thanks to all who took part in our HackerClub Competition last
week, you guys can expect one or two next semester again! A special
congratulations to Sean Hammond, Shane Grouse and Conor Berns, our first, second
and third placed participants respectively. Well done guys!

Seeing as it is Computer Science Education Week and all, HackerClub will resume
as normal for this week, except it's going to be in L125 (it's a nicer room).
During this week's session we will be solving problems as usual, but with an
added twist! You'll be helping us too this week! On Thursday we will be asking
you guys what we can change up for next semester's instalment of HackerClub! If
you feel we can make HackerClub better please come along and let us know!

## Exams Are Coming!

The end of semester one is nigh! The last few days of this semester are upon us,
and with them comes a little bit of winter weariness. We know, we know, it's
been a long semester. After the break you'll all be facing into your semester
one exams! We at Redbrick want to wish you all the best of luck in your studies
and subsequent January Exams!

## Merry Christmas To All

Finally, from myself and the rest of committee, we would like to wish you all a
very joyous and very safe Christmas. Enjoy the break, watch some movies (Home
Alone is a must), and eat some fantastically delicious dinner when the big day
finally arrives. Take care everybody, we can't wait to see you all next
semester!

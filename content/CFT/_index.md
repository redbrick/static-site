title: Call for Talks
---

Redbrick are looking for people to come and talk to our members, and we'd like
to hear from you! We'd like people to come and talk to us about all aspects of
software engineering, operations, networking, or anything that you’re passionate
about. Some talks we've had in the past that we've enjoyed have included:

- Security
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Virtualisation
- Mobile Development
- Development tools
- Web Design
- Distributed Systems
- Open Source Software
- Networking
- Linux
- Hardware
- Frameworks

## What we want?

We want people to come and talk to us! We’d love to hear about any relevant
topic that you’re passionate about, or want to spread the word about. We’re open
to any ideas, so if you think that you have an idea for a talk, just email us at
committee@redbrick.dcu.ie with a short description and we’ll see what we can
organise.

We hold weekly tutorials and talks, usually run by members of the committee, but
often by our associate members (former students and staff of DCU) and other
people from the industry.

Since we’re a college society, we tend to try organise talks during the
semester, and to work around lecture schedules. Typically this is from September
to December, and February to June. We normally meet on Monday/Tuesday/Thursday
between 4 and 6pm, or on Wednesday between 2 and 5pm. We’re flexible though, so
don't let that put you off!

## Who are we?

Redbrick is the Computer Networking society in DCU. We started in 1996, and
since then we've been building a community of members with a common interest:
All things tech. We aim to make a great environment to learn new skills and
technologies and to meet other people with a common interest.

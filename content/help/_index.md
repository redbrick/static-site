The Redbrick Helpdesk is staffed by our team of highly skilled volunteer
Education Officers. The Helpdesk write and maintain a series of tutorials on
Redbrick's systems. These are available on our wiki. The Helpdesk team can also
be contacted by Email, and over IRC in the channel #helpdesk. You can access IRC
by using one of the methods available [here](/help/tutorials/IntroToRedbrick/).
The Helpdesk can be emailed at the
[Helpdesk Email address](mailto:helpdesk@redbrick.dcu.ie).

title: 'Admin test 2007 AGM'

 <sub> - [Helpdesk](../) - [Joining](../joining) - [Tutorials](../tutorials) - [Exams](../exams) -</sub>
All questions can be answered in the context of any version of UNIX (except for the FreeBSD and Linux sections obviously!). Indicating which version of UNIX you refer to in your answer is preferred but not required. Negative marking applies throughout for answers that are clearly incorrect or demonstrate incompetence.

Humourous answers while appreciated gain no extra marks*. **Keep answers short and concise** - don't waste time writing when one or two word answers will suffice.  

<small>* - Although, it will put us in a better mood while correcting.</small>

**ALL SECTIONS ARE *NOT* EQUALLY WEIGHTED**

The test is marked out of an arbitrary number equal to two times the bisection of the set of available marks, as outlined by the numbers beside the questions and sections (they're not just there to look pretty).

### The Rules

*   You ***must*** be mesg n for the duration of the test. Any attempt to communicate with other users will result in immediate disqualification. Big Brother is watching you.
*   During the scripting section ***only***, you may refer to the system documentation (man & info pages) for help. You ***may not*** use any external documentation, i.e. no web access! Don't forget, Big Brother is still watching you.
*   You are free to use whatever shell or scripting language you wish to write the scripts (except brainfuck and whitespace. Admins are people too!). Only system commands may be used: yours or other users' scripts ***may not*** be referred to. Basically: No cheating! Big Brother will be checking.
*   Make a directory called ~/admintest, and place scripts and answers in there. Name each script by its question number. Don't forget: Humorous error messages make your scripts run faster. Big Brother likes humorous error messages.

Best of luck!

## Scripting (40 marks)

**Whilst we hope your scripts run correctly, the emphasis is on the procedure rather than a perfectly working implementation.** (That and humorous error messages...)

Here we go..

1.  Help! Help! Big Brother turned his back for a minute, and someone's gone and written "OMG WAF TBH" at the end of every world-writable file on the system. Write a script that prints out a list of all world-writable files on the system and removes "OMG WAF TBH" from the file. For a bonus mark, mail the user with the name of the file, and call them a big OMG WAF for having world-writable files.

<pre>FAILDESK TEST - 2008 AGM  

ROOLZ!!!11eleventyone!11!!!  

1\. Each question is worth three (3) marks, unless otherwise specified.</pre>

<pre>The pass mark is 40\. One (1) mark is reserved for humour and it will be awarded if your answers make the person correcting your exam laugh out loud at all. Therefore, if your answers are not funny, your highest possible </pre>

<pre>score is 99.  

2\. In previous tests it has been necessary for you to answer questions as though you were actually replying to the user. While we may mark your exam more favourably if you do, if you are stuck for time, you needn't bother.  

3\. Write your answers on a separate page and number them.  

4\. Assume that all users are using the following:  
   chat: irssi  
   mail: mutt  
   news: slrn  

5\. If you don't know the answer, you can still receive partial marks for telling the user exactly where to find it (for example, if they want to know   
how to view the permissions for their files in a directory and you don't know about ls -l you can tell them that man ls will give them the info they   
need.)  

6\. Answers such as "RTFM" and "check a search engine" won't get you any marks.  

The internet is full of idiots. RedBrick is no exception. As a member of helpdesk your mission is to break your back helping people who are less   
knowledgeable than you. It's a difficult, thankless job, but somebody has to do it. Will that somebody be you? *dramatic music*  

Good luck!

get rid of my website etc. My username is: fagface and my password is:

title: 'Admin Test 2005 EGM'
---

All questions can be answered in the context of any version of UNIX (except for the Solaris, FreeBSD and Linux sections obviously!). Indicating which version of UNIX you refer to in your answer is preferred but not required. Negative marking applies throughout for answers that are clearly incorrect or demonstrate incompetence.

Humourous answers while appreciated gain no extra marks. **Keep answers short and concise** - don't waste time writing when one or two word answers will suffice.

**ALL SECTIONS ARE *NOT* EQUALLY WEIGHTED**

The test is marked out of 300.

Best of luck!

## 0\. Scripting (40 marks)

**Rules:**

*   You must be mesg n for duration of test. Any attempt to communicate with other users will result in immediate failure.
*   You may only refer to system documentation (man & info pages) for help, i.e. no web access!
*   You are free to use any shell or scripting language to write the scripts. Only system commands may be used, your own or other user scripts may not be referred to. Basically: no cheating!
*   Make a directory ~/admintest and place scripts in there. Name each script by its question number. Humorous error messages make your scripts run faster.

**Whilst we hope your scripts run correctly, the emphasis is on the procedure rather than a perfectly working implementation.**

Here we go..

1.  One of the admins made a silly mistake in the exim config. For a few hours, new mail was delivered to ~/MaildirX rather than ~/Maildir. A couple of hundred users have been affected. No mail has been lost, but it's sitting in the wrong directory.

    Write a quick script to move everybody's mail in MaildirX into their normal Maildir.

    An example usage is:

    <pre># ./fixmail</pre>

    <span class="mark">(16 marks)</span>
2.  For some reason, a bunch of users don't have a quota.

    Write a script to set the default quota for users with none set.

    An example usage is:

    <pre># ./fixzeroquotas</pre>

    <span class="mark">(17 marks)</span>
3.  Plenty of users have world-writable files in their webspace.

    Write a script to produce a list of group and world writable files in /webtree, sorted by username.

    Example usage:

    <pre># ./checkwritable
    auser:
    /webtree/a/auser/something
    buser:
    /webtree/b/buser/stuff
    /webtree/b/buser/things
    bzuser:
    /webtree/b/bzuser/meh
    /webtree/b/bzuser/fmeh</pre>

1 - So, upstart is shit. You've noticed that it doesn't seem to start syslog-ng.  
Write a script to check if it's running. If it isn't, start it. (13 marks)  

2 - Some cunts keep housing warez on their webspace and the IRMA or IMRO or whatever they're calling themselves this week are fed up sending us cease and desists. Once more strike and we're out. Write me a script that searches /webtree for files of the following types (mp3, avi, wma, wmv, aac, flac), chmods the files to 000, emails the user with a warning to take it down, and emails a list of files to admins@(15 marks)  

3 -We're moving /storage from minerva to azazel. Some users (cough cough) have a bigger quota than the default 2G. This will mess everythig up for cunts like fun when we move. Write me a script to check all users quotas and email a list of all users with non-default quotas to admins@redbrick.dcu.ie in the following format:  
Username Quota  
(8 marks) Some users also have a different filesize quota (default is 150M), email a list of users with a bigger filesize quota to admins in the form:  
Username Filesize_quota  
Hint: limits.conf (5 marks)  

4 - Write a script that amuses me. (2 mark)

6) How do I attach documents in mutt?

7) According to a friend of mine, I was told that there is something wrong
 with my path as I was unable to run some executable programs that I compiled
 myself in my own directory. Could you help me sort this problem out? 

8) I want to know how would I go about logging straight into a shell
instead of Flin. What I mean is how do i change my shell from Flin to tcsh?

to save the message to a temp file only then can i send it.

for this 'service'. If you don't do something about it, I want my money
back.

'chmod -R 744 public_html/', but still when I try to access my page, it
says that I don't have permission to access this file. What am I doing
wrong?

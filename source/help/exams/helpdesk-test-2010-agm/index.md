1. Hey guys,
    I was using bash a while ago until I realised that zsh is uber 1337.
    Anyway, when I ls'd while using bash my directories, executables and
    files were all colouredy. Any way to do this with zsh/other shells?

2. [================== Hey guys ==================]
    Listen, #lobby is epic and all with HAUK and
    LITHIUM talking about brewing and gardening
    all day, but are there any other channels out
    there? If so, how do I find out what they are?
    Oh, and can I make my own?
    Thanks,
    HAUKIUM
    [================== Bye guys ==================]
3. Hey helpdesk,
    So here's the thing, my gmail gets forwarded to my redbrick account, but
    it all gets mixed up with my really important redbrick emails. So, I was
    wondering if there is anyway to have filters or something in mutt? And
    how would I filter my mail from gmail and redbrick if I can do this?
    Jane Smith
4. Can you recommend any text editors on redbrick? I need to edit my website but I don't want to upload the html file every time.
5. Hey,
    I made a webpage on my laptop and I was wondering how I can FTP it
    up onto redbrick? Thanks

6. Howdy :D
    I just wanted to know is there something anywhere to teach vim to users?
    And the last time I tried to use vim I couldn't close it for the life of
    me, how do I close it?
7. Hey, so Cindella was teaching me this thing where I can stay logged into
    chat and that sort of stuff, but I didn't really get it. What is this
    witchcraft? Oh! And how do I get back to chat after I close my terminal?

8. Hey,
    So I was heying some friends the other day and I noticed that my friends
    border was really sweet, any tips on how to get some nice heys going on?
    They were using some commandline arguments I think. Is there an easier way?

	Hey guys,  
	I was using bash a while ago until I realised that zsh is uber 1337.  
	Anyway, when I ls'd while using bash my directories, executables and  
	files were all colouredy. Any way to do this with zsh/other shells?

		[================== Hey guys ==================]  
		 Listen, #lobby is epic and all with HAUK and  
		 LITHIUM talking about brewing and gardening  
		 all day, but are there any other channels out  
		 there? If so, how do I find out what they are?  
		 Oh, and can I make my own?  
		 Thanks,

	Hey helpdesk,  
	So here's the thing, my gmail gets forwarded to my redbrick account, but  
	it all gets mixed up with my really important redbrick emails. So, I was  
	wondering if there is anyway to have filters or something in mutt? And  
	how would I filter my mail from gmail and redbrick if I can do this?  
	Jane Smith  

4.  
	Can you recommend any text editors on redbrick? I need to edit my   
	website but I don't want to upload the html file every time.  

5.  
	Hey,  
	I made a webpage on my laptop and I was wondering how I can FTP it  
	up onto redbrick? Thanks  
	John Smith  

6.  
	Howdy :D  
	I just wanted to know is there something anywhere to teach vim to users?  
	And the last time I tried to use vim I couldn't close it for the life of  
	me, how do I close it?  

7.  
	Hey, so Cindella was teaching me this thing where I can stay logged into  
	chat and that sort of stuff, but I didn't really get it. What is this  
	witchcraft? Oh! And how do I get back to chat after I close my terminal?  
	Kthnxbai  

8.  
	Hey,  
	So I was heying some friends the other day and I noticed that my friends  
	border was really sweet, any tips on how to get some nice heys going on?  
	They were using some commandline arguments I think. Is there an easier  
	way?

	my emails in mutt, is there a way to do this?

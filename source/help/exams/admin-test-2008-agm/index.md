220 marks total. All rounds are weighted equally, at 30 marks, except for scripting which is worth 40 marks.

The first half hour is for scripting. During this time, man and info pages (along with perldoc, etc - anything that's **preinstalled on redbrick**, no external docs allowed!) may be accessed. After this time, you may not access anything other then your text editor. We're watching you. Cian has a gun.

### Scripting

###### 40 marks

1.  It's the year 2017, and we've finally run out of disk space on Minerva. Write a script to look for PHP files (ending in .php) and check whether or not a hash line (#!/usr/local/bin/php) exists. If it does, remove the line (to free disk space
2.  Another one related to internets. Write a script that scans for PHP files that are world readable, and contain the string "$mysql_password = "(anything)";. For every file found, automagically insult the owner via email, and mail the string found to zyox@redbrick.dcu.ie.
3.  Write a script that generates the md5 sum of every file under /etc, and saves it, along with the filename, to /root/md5sums. Then have it compare /root/md5sums to /root/md5sums.old, and email any changes to rb-admins@lists.redbrick.dcu.ie. Extra marks if you can make this suitable for cron (i.e rotates md5sum and md5sum.old automatically).

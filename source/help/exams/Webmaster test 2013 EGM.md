<pre>[ WEBMASTER EXAM 2013 ]

Note on the root section: This section does not specifically test your ability as webmaster, 
but tests your root competency. As such, if you fail this section, the score will not count 
towards the overall test score, and all other questions will be marked out of 90 - you just 
won't be given root access. If you pass this section, however, it will positively affect your 
ability to carry out webmaster duties, and as such the entire test will be marked out of 130.

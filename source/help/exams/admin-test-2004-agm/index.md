title: 'Admin Test 2004 AGM'
---

 <sub> - [Helpdesk](../../) - [Joining](../../joining) - [Tutorials](../../tutorials) - [Exams](../../exams) -</sub>
All questions can be answered in the context of any version of UNIX (except for the Solaris, FreeBSD and Linux sections obviously!). Indicating which version of UNIX you refer to in your answer is preferred but not required. Negative marking applies throughout for answers that are clearly incorrect or demonstrate incompetence.

Humourous answers while appreciated gain no extra marks. **Keep answers short and concise** - don't waste time writing when one or two word answers will suffice.

**ALL SECTIONS ARE *NOT* EQUALLY WEIGHTED**

The test is marked out of 300.

Best of luck!

## 0\. Scripting (40 marks)

**Rules:**

*   You must be mesg n for duration of test. Any attempt to communicate with other users will result in immediate failure.
*   You may only refer to system documentation (man & info pages) for help, i.e. no web access!
*   You are free to use any shell or scripting language to write the scripts. Only system commands may be used, your own or other user scripts may not be referred to. Basically: no cheating!
*   Make a directory ~/admintest and place scripts in there. Name each script by its question number. Humorous error messages make your scripts run faster.

**Whilst we hope your scripts run correctly, the emphasis is on the procedure rather than a perfectly working implmenetation.**

Here we go..

1.  Write a script which makes a md5sum of every executable file in the system path and stores it to a file. The script should check against a file left the previous day for differences and report a change to admins via mail.

    An example usage is:

    <pre>./systemcheck</pre>

    <span class="mark">(13.333 marks)</span>
2.  Due to Marks enormous porn collection, /home on Redbrick is rapidly filling up. We need more space dammit.

    Your job, should you choose to accept it, is to write a script that goes through a directory and mails the owners of the top 10 largest files asking them to free up some space.

    Mark is good with his tongue though, so any of his files are to be ignored.

    An example usage is:

    <pre>./toptenmail /home
    </pre>

    This will mail the owners of the top ten largest files in /home (but any files owned by Mark are skipped).

    .. or ..

    <pre>./toptenmail /webtree
    </pre>

    <span class="mark">(13.333 marks)</span>
3.  Some of the committee mailing list archive files have been stolen! You don't know which files have been taken. You do know the perpetrator is an associate and also that he's clever enough to change the names of the files he has copied. A list of md5sums of all of the committee archives is contained in the file sums.log in the format

    <pre>d542034f417e7e4e45eeba42e2ec4884  2000-December.txt

    4c089e4be4e8e1f6a5133f3914db5b7b  2004-February.txt

    </pre>

    Write a script that will search through /home/associat and record the full path of any file which matches any of the md5sums in sum.log, in the file results.log. A copy of this list should also be mailed to admins@redbrick.dcu.ie.

6.  Roughly Compare and contrast IDE/SCSI/SATA under the following headings:

    3.  Typical device RPM?
    4.  Cable lengths and sizes?<span class="mark">(4 marks)</span>
7.  You notice 'CS' marked at the back of a new IDE drive you buy. What on Earth does that mean? <span class="mark">(2 marks)</span>
8.  You've just bought a brand new Sun server. It claims to come equipped with a video card. But con-sarn-it there doesn't seem to be a monitor connector that'll fit your PC monitor. What gives? Explain two ways of getting around this? <span class="mark">(4 marks)</span>

## 7\. Networking (30 marks)

    How can you find out the PID of this unauthorised server and kill it off.

    <span class="mark">(2 marks)</span>
2.  sshd runs under the 'ssh' user, but you're not exactly familar with process of starting sshd. You first 'su' to ssh, but upon starting it see the following error message:

    <pre>Could not bind to port 22.</pre>

    List 2 such ranges.

    Why would you want to use one?

    <span class="mark">(3 marks)</span>
7.  One of your fellow admins suggests running LDAP from inetd using the nowait flag. After you've beaten him to a pulp and he's being carried away by paramedics, you explain, including details of how inetd works, why this is such a bad idea... <span class="mark">(3 marks)</span>

6.  Assume the role of the hacker. You cross dress as a hot chick (if nessassary), you bring Dizer to the bar and you're being very flirty.

    There's alot of alcohol being consumed and well Dermot isn't eactly picky. He invites you up to the server room, he want to show you his "root kit".

    While your up there he passes out for 2 minutes leaving himself logged in as root. How would you backdoor the system so that you can esclate your privilages from your user account easily at a later time?

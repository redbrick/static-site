 --------------------------------
--- Practical (40 Marks) ---

1\. (5 Marks)
Create a user 'ted' with a home directory of '/home/ted' 

adduser ted

2\. (5 Marks)
Make ted a member of 'harry' group and give that group write access to 
directory '/home/ted/shared' 

groupadd harry
chown ted:harry /home/ted/shared
chmod g+w /home/ted/shared

3\. (5 Marks)
Force the directory contents to be owned by the 'harry' group.

chmod g+s /home/ted/shared
chown -R ted:harry /home/ted/shared

4\. (10 Marks)
The VM you are using has a free unformated partition. Format this partion 
to be swap and make the VM mount the swap patition at startup.

mkswap /dev/sda3
swapon /dev/sda3

add the following to /etc/fstab:

/dev/sda3 none swap sw 0 0

5\. (15 Marks)
Create a cron job that will synchronise the contents of /etc/ every night 
to a remote server over ssh. (remote server details are provided on your 
handout)

crontab -e: 
add the following:
0 0 * * * rsync -avz -e ssh /etc user@backup:/home/user/backup

make ssh keys:
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -f /path/to/sshkeys
copy the public part to the backup server:
scp ./key.pub backup:/home/user/

ssh to backup server and add the public key into ~/.ssh/authorized_hosts
cat key.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_hosts

--- Scripting (40 Marks) ---

1\. (13 Marks)
We are replacing tcsh because it is shit. Find all users with tcsh, and 
change their shell to bash. Email the user to tell them of the change

#!/bin/bash

tcshusers=$(getent passwd | grep tcsh | cut -d: -f 1)
for user in $tcshusers
do
   chsh $user -s /bin/bash
   echo "We changed your shell" | mail -s "chsh" "$user@redbrick.dcu.ie"
done

2\. (13 Marks)
It has come to our attention that a number of users have been storing out 
of date lecture notes on their webspace.
We have been provided with a copy of each of the files.
Scan /webtree for any copies of these files and if they are world readable 
and not password protected email admins if one is found. (You can ignore 
users home directories for this question.)

#!/usr/bin/env python
import subprocess
import hashlib
import smtplib

from email.mime.text import MIMEText

#Many enhancements could be made to this, but It is at least correct. 
#This solution assumes that we cannot take into account the file extension.

#get a list of all the lecture files.
#This assumes they are in "./files"
findoutput = subprocess.check_output(
         ["find", "./files", "-type", "f"])
lecfiles = findoutput.split("\n")[:-1]

#md5 hashes the files and puts these hashes into a list
lecture_md5s = []
for f in lecfiles:
   lecture_md5s.append(hashlib.md5(open(f, "rb").read()).hexdigest())

#get a list of all world-readable files from /webtree
findoutput = subprocess.check_output(
         ["find", "/webtree", "-type", "f", "-perm", "/o+r"])
webtreefiles = findoutput.split("\n")[:-1]

#Make a dictionary of file paths to MD5 sums of the world-readable files 
#of /webtree
webtree_dict = {}
for f in webtreefiles:
   webtree_dict[f] = hashlib.md5(open(f, "rb").read()).hexdigest()

violations = []
for f, md5 in webtree_dict.iteritems():
   if md5 in lecture_md5s:
      violations.append(md5 + " " + f)

violations_string = "\n".join(violations)
msg = MIMEText(violations_string)
msg["subject"] = "world-readable lecture notes"
msg["from"] = "notesbot"
msg["to"] = "gw@redbrick.dcu.ie"

s = smtplib.SMTP("localhost")
s.sendmail("notesbot", "gw@redbrick.dcu.ie", msg)
s.quit()

3\. (13 Marks)
We believe that a number of users are abusing redbrick services.
Specifically they are running programs that are not allowed. Write a script 
that takes a list of usernames as an argument and will detect if they are 
running any of these programs. If you see the same user running banned 
programs more than 3 times automatically change their shell to disusered. 
Email admins to inform us of the users poor choices. (You may choose which 
programs are banned.)

#!/bin/bash

userlist=$1
bannedprocs="ssh|mutt|vim"
email="banned users were:\n\n"
for user in $userlist
do
   numprocs=$(pgrep -u $user -c $bannedprocs"")
   if [ $numprocs -gt 3 ] 
   then
      chsh $user -s /usr/local/shells/disusered
      email="$email $user"
   fi  
done
echo "$email" | mail -s "people got banned" admins@redbrick.dcu.ie

4\. Write a script to amuse me. (1 Mark)

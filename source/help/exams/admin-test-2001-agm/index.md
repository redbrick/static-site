<pre>Redbrick Admin Test : - written by Noel Fitzpatrick (noelfitz) proofed by Phil
Reynolds (phil).
                        contributions by Dave Murphy (drjolt) and Brian
Scanlan (singer).

The test is split up into 10 different areas these areas do not carry equal
marks,
they have no relevance to the marking scheme at all they are simply there to
give
candidates an idea of what is expected of them from each group of questions.

Things to note - the scripting section is worth 20% as our the OS specific
questions.
                 (ie 10% for each).

All questions bar the FreeBSD and Solaris questions can be answered in the
context of any
form of Unix you wish. You are not required to  specify the Unix in which
context you are
answering the questions but I would advice you do as to narrow the possible
margin of error.

Good luck to you all!

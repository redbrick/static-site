 <sub> - [Helpdesk](../../) - [Joining](../../joining) - [Tutorials](../../tutorials) - [Exams](../../exams) -</sub>
Instructions:  
1\. Most questions appear in the form of a hey/mail from a redbrick user  
2\. Answer as if you were replying to the user.  
3\. Write your answers on a separate page and number them for ease of  
correction.  
4\. You can assume for the questions, that the user is using the following  
programs (unless specified otherwise):  
• Email: mutt  
• News: slrn  
• IRC: irssi  
5\. Unless otherwise specified, each question is worth 3 marks.  
6\. Some questions won’t have obvious answers, in this case you’ll get marks  
for knowing what to ask the user next (i/e user:‘whats my username’ –  
you:‘erm, what’s your DCU mail address and I’ll look you up?’)  
7\. ‘RTFM’ / ‘Just Google it’ is not a valid answer to most questions. It might  
sometimes be acceptable, but you’ll need to be a little more specific than  
that.  
8\. Possible bonus marks for amusing answers. ASCII porn not accepted.

Best of luck 

Hi,  
I just tried to log in to my redbrick account (luna) and get the access  
denied message after entering my password. I am pretty sure I have the right  
password, can you shed any light on this?  
Thanks,  
Maire

Hi,  
My name's Noel, I'm the chair of DCU Young Fine Gael (~finegael to you :)!  
) and I was wondering, would it be at all possible to get the password and  
the parameters I'd need to log in over FTP? That'd be great - hope it isn't  
too much hassle!  
Kind regards,  
Noel

Hi,  
Entirely my own fault here, I suspect, but I'm having issues logging  
into Redbrick.  I had my account renewed and went to log in without  
checking the renewal mail to see my password had been reset.  So I  
had a number of failed logins.  At this point, while I get the login  
prompt, entering the password as supplied by you guys makes my putty  
screen disappear in a puff of logic.  I'm reasonably sure it isn't an  
issue with putty, so could my password be reset and I will try again  
(after reading everything carefully, of course!)?  
Thanks,  
Brian.

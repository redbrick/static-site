title: 'Admin Test 2006 AGM'
---

 <sub> - [Helpdesk](../) - [Joining](../joining) - [Tutorials](../tutorials) - [Exams](../exams) -</sub>
All questions can be answered in the context of any version of UNIX (except for the Solaris, FreeBSD and Linux sections obviously!). Indicating which version of UNIX you refer to in your answer is preferred but not required. Negative marking applies throughout for answers that are clearly incorrect or demonstrate incompetence.

Humourous answers while appreciated gain no extra marks. **Keep answers short and concise** - don't waste time writing when one or two word answers will suffice.

**ALL SECTIONS ARE *NOT* EQUALLY WEIGHTED**

The test is marked out of 300.

Best of luck!

## 0\. Scripting (40 marks)

**Rules:**

*   You must be mesg n for duration of test. Any attempt to communicate with other users will result in immediate failure.
*   You may only refer to system documentation (man & info pages) for help, i.e. no web access!
*   You are free to use any shell or scripting language to write the scripts. Only system commands may be used, your own or other user scripts may not be referred to. Basically: no cheating!
*   Make a directory ~/admintest and place scripts in there. Name each script by its question number. Humorous error messages make your scripts run faster.

**Whilst we hope your scripts run correctly, the emphasis is on the procedure rather than a perfectly working implementation.**

Here we go..

1.  Redbrick has started receiving letters from the various Irish organisations who deal like to complain about illegal material being available on the internet. The webmaster has...forgotten...to pay much attention to this situation. Write a script to find all files in /webtree with the following extensions: "mp3, wma, wmv, rm, ra, ogg, avi, mov, m4a, mpg, mpeg". Make sure the search is case insensitive. Write this to a file (as we will need it to find "culprits") and present it in the form:

    <pre>username :: group -:- chmod_of_file :-: size_in_kilobytes - path</pre>

    Write to the file "omfg_busted_zing.txt"  
    <span class="mark">(13 marks)</span>
2.  Process this list so that it generates a report. The report should be as follows:

    <pre>chmod :: number_of_files :-: size_in_kilobytes_in_total -:- number_of_members</pre>

    <span class="mark">(13 marks)</span>
3.  Also process the list so that the top 10 users with the largest combined file sizes are listed as:

    <pre>username :: group :-: total_file_size -:- largest_file</pre>

    with a full list written to "fscking_users.txt"  
    <span class="mark">(14 marks)</span>

## 1\. Solaris - with thanks to dizer (30 marks)

Listen up maggots, as part of this job you're going to be anally gang raped by Sun Microsystems. And you're going to have to learn to like it, soliders. With time, you'll enjoy the feeling of a cool hard E450 on your ass cheeks.  

Now pay attention you slimey cunt fucks.

1.  You commie bastards think you're so fuckin' smart eh? Then tell me what 'logging' means on Solaris UFS. <span class="mark">(4 marks)</span>
2.  WHAT DID YOU SAY! /usr and / on separate partitions on a Solaris system? Either you tell me why this is a bad idea, or I'll teach your sister all about 'partitioning'. <span class="mark">(4 marks)</span>
3.  Ah not again. Some anal sucking mommas boy left the air conditioning off again. Your Sun system is probably overheating like your Dad on a cheap Thai hooker. What command can I use to find out the temperature of your system? <span class="mark">(2 marks)</span>
4.  Sun in their infinite wisdom left a nasty little kernel bug in a version of Solaris running on Redbrick. What online resource do you use to patch against this? Your mommy can't help you now fagboy. <span class="mark">(1 marks)</span>

    *   /kernel
    *   /opt
    *   /platform<span class="mark">(5 marks)</span>
10.  Stop interfacing with your hand and interface with the network. You need to setup a network alias on a running network interface (say hme0) and ensure it is persistent across reboots. How do you go about this, with emphasis on the persistency. <span class="mark">(4 marks)</span>

10.  You've just compiled a new kernel and you reboot. Everything seems to be going ok until you get the dreaded KERNEL PANIC message. You notice messages about ext3 filesystems not being mounted. What might be the cause of this? <span class="mark">(4 marks)</span>

## 4\. LDAP (20 marks)

1.  Sometimes LDAP needs to be reindexed. The main part of the reindexing process is stopping LDAP, exporting the LDAP database to an LDIF file, readding all the entries from the file and restarting LDAP.

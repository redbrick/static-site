Hi all
I am a final year business student.
I am currently working on My FYP and have run into difficulty in a particular section.
The project is to develop a conceptual framework for the development of an e-Supply Chain Management (e-SCM) System for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs).
The goal is not to develop the product, rather to envision:
-What the product should look like. 
-What features and functionalities it should have.
-What tools could be used to develop the modules of the software system.
-What are the commercialisation pathways for such a tool

I am having issues with a particular section where I must devise a software development plan. I have no background in software development or programming so i am struggling to understand the requirements. I was wondering if it might be possible to meet with a member of your team to talk about the information and requirements for such a task. thank you for your time.

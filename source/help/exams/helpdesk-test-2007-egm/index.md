*   Hi,  
    I'm having a problem with getting java to work through command prompt. When I type in 'javac' the error message I keep getting is "javac is not recognised as an internal or external command,operable program or batch file."I've tried re-installing the cd several times but keep getting the same problem. Do you have any ideas on how to fix this?  
    Thanks,  
    A Person.
*   I'm having issues changing my display name. CHFN doesn't seem to be working for me. I'd appreciate any help you could give me on this. I created a thread on redbrick.babble called 'Changing Display Name??' which has some more info on it.  
    Shadow just suggested using `/local/bin/chfn` as that worked for him but I get the same result..

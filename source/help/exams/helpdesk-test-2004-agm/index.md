<span style="font-size: 11pt;">Howdy,  
         Below are 33 questions regarding ``how do I use redbrick''. All questions are in the  
form of a mail or hey from our imaginary user <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">jblg@rebrick.dcu.ie. <span style="color: #000000;">All questions should be  
answered as if you were actually replying to him for real. Each question is worth either 3  
but you should try and get as much into your answers as possible, as there may be more  
than 1 correct response.  

You can assume for the questions that the user is using the following programs.  
Mutt     (for mail)  
Slrn     (for news)  
BitchX   (for chat)  

Best of luck

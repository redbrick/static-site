**27.** Hi all  
I am a final year business student.  
I am currently working on My FYP and have run into difficulty in a particular section.  
The project is to develop a conceptual framework for the development of an e-Supply Chain Management (e-SCM) System for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs).  
The goal is not to develop the product, rather to envision:  
-What the product should look like.  
-What features and functionalities it should have.  
-What tools could be used to develop the modules of the software system.  
-What are the commercialisation pathways for such a tool  

I am having issues with a particular section where I must devise a software development plan. I have no background in software development or programming so i am struggling to understand the requirements.  
I was wondering if it might be possible to meet with a member of your team to talk about the information and requirements for such a task. thank you for your time. (3 Marks)

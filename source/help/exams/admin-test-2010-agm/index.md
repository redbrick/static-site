title: 'Admin Test 2010 AGM'
---

## The rules

1.  **ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD.**
2.  The first half hour is for scripting. During this time, man, info, apropos, perldoc, pydoc, etc (anything that's installed on redbrick) may be accessed. The internet may not.
3.  After the first half hour you may not access anything other than a text editor.
4.  We're watching you. Any trouble and sonic will throw you out a window.
5.  All sections are probably not weighted equally. Probably. W're not quite sure yet.
6.  The whole test is out of 267\. Yep, 267.
7.  **ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD.**

## Section 1, Scripting

40 marks

1.  Write a script to tell you how much space each user is using in their HOME directory and how many files they have greater than 150mb. Output should be:  

    <pre>SpaceUsed Username NumFiles</pre>

    However it should be sorted by alphabetically by Username. (13 marks)
2.  Write a script that checks whether or not a user has a quota on /dev/sda1 (/storage on Minerva). If they don't, then check whether or not they have more then 2GB of files in their home directory. If not, set them a 2GB quota. If they do have more then 2GB of files, email admins@redbrick.dcu.ie to prod someone to look at the situation manually. (13 marks)
3.  Write a script that takes 6 usernames and monitors what processes they are running during the admin test. If any of the users run any of 3 forbidden binaries simultaneously (you get to pick the forbidden binaries, aren't we nice?) they are heyed (assume mesg y) saying they are cheating gits and to "stop or else". Also, if **any** of the offending processes are running, kill them immediately. (13 marks)
4.  Write a script that monitors incoming mail for the word "GRAND", "PLANTS", "BBQ" or "TFAS". If any is found, send it to /dev/null and cat /boot/vmlinuz all over that user's terminal. (1 mark, but we'll really like you and be nicer marking the rest).

## Hardware

(33 marks)

1.  Redbrick recently bought a giant storage array.It's a direct attached storage device connecting to a SAS RAID controller (a Dell PERC6/E sitting in minerva). It contains 10 15000RPM 3.5" SAS disks in RAID 10, has two power supplies and shows up on Linux as /dev/sda.
    *   What's the difference between a direct attached storage device and a network attached storage device? (1 mark)
    *   What's RAID do (in general, no need for discussion on individual levels). (1 mark)

Name one other type of interface you might find on a disk in the Redbrick room, and name one other common disk speed that you might find in the redbrick room. Regarding the interface, is it generally slower or faster then a SAS interface? (3 marks)
    *   Why would we want two power supplies in a piece of hardware? (1 mark).
    *   There's ten disks. /dev/sda only represents one disk. Why is this? (2 marks).(1+1+3+3+1+2 = 11 marks)

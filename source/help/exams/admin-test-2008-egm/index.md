title: 'Admin test 2008 EGM'
---

<pre id="line1">ll questions can be answered in the context of any version of UNIX 
(except for the FreeBSD and Linux sections obviously!). Indicating which 
version of UNIX you refer to in your answer is preferred but not required. 
Negative marking applies throughout for answers that are clearly incorrect 
or demonstrate incompetence.

Humourous answers while appreciated gain no extra marks*. Keep answers short
and concise - don't waste time writing when one or two word answers will 
suffice.

* - Although, it will put us in a better mood while correcting.

ALL SECTIONS ARE *NOT* EQUALLY WEIGHTED

The test is marked out of an arbitrary number equal to two times the 
bisection of the set of available marks, as outlined by the numbers beside 
the questions and sections (they're not just there to look pretty).

The Rules

    * You *must* be mesg n for the duration of the test. Any attempt to 
    communicate with other users will result in immediate disqualification. 
    Big Brother is watching you.

    * During the scripting section *only*, you may refer to the system 
    documentation (man & info pages) for help. You *may not* use any external 
    documentation, i.e. no web access! Don't forget, Big Brother is still 
    watching you.

    * You are free to use whatever shell or scripting language you wish to 
    write the scripts (except brainfuck and whitespace. Admins are people 
    too!). Only system commands may be used: yours or other users' scripts 
    *may not* be referred to. Basically: No cheating! Big Brother will be 
    checking.

    * Make a directory called ~/admintest, and place scripts and answers in 
    there. Name each script by its question number. Don't forget: Humorous 
    error messages make your scripts run faster. Big Brother likes humorous 
    error messages.

All questions that don't have marks next to them are marked equally.

=======[ Scripting (40 marks) ]=======

1\. Write a script or command, in the scripting language or shell of your
 choice, to search every file in every members home directory (ignore 
 associates, cos they're too nice) for the string "i hate ". If the string is found, wipe the user's home directory
 and make their terminal print "GTFO" and exit when they attempt to log in.
 (13 marks)

2\. We've just moved our storage partition from a certain unnamed 180GB array
 to another certain unnamed 3.26TB array. Write a script to give each user a
 1GB quota on that new array (call it /dev/sda1, mounted as /storage). If the
 user's old quota (on 192.168.0.3:/home) was greater than 1GB, then just let
 them keep their old quota. (Ignore /webtree - for the purpose of this question, 
 it doesn't exist. I know, I know, I'm far too nice). (13 marks)

3\. You've just installed Ubuntu Server, and found that it's default groups are 
 all screwey. When you mount /storage, you notice that member's home directories 
 are in the group "syslog". Oh noes! You rectify this by swapping the syslog 
 and member GIDs in /etc/group, but you want to make sure that none of the files 
 in the default installation belonged to syslog ('cos they'd now belong to "member"). 
 Write a script that scans the filesystem (excluding /storage), lists any files 
 now in the group "member", changes the group to syslog, and then prints a report 
 of how many files it had to modify at the end. (14 marks)

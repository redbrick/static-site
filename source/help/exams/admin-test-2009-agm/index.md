277 marks total. All rounds are not weighted equally.

The first half hour is for scripting. During this time, man and info pages (along with perldoc, etc - anything that's **preinstalled on redbrick**, no external docs allowed!) may be accessed. After this time, you may not access anything other then your text editor. We're watching you. Johan has a knife.

### scripting

###### 40 marks

It's 2008 and RedBrick has been haxxored, you alone must write a bunch of hacky scripts to sort it out.

1.  Firstly you must email all the users, because they're angry and don't know what's going on. However, deathray is shitting itself, so using mailman is out of the question - All you have is an ldif file. Use the ldif file to email every user at both their redbrick and altmail addresses. (an example ldif is in /var/tmp) (13 marks).
2.  So, now the users know, but all their websites are still replaced by rooted bricks. Luckily the original html file has been saved as index.waf. Write a script that finds all the index.waf files in /webtree and renames them to index.html (13 marks)
3.  That mostly worked, but some users didn't have an original index.html so their brick page wasn't replaced. Write a script to check the differences between every index.html and the one in /var/tmp. If they're indentical then delete the users' index.html (13 marks)
4.  Write a script to amuse me (1 mark)

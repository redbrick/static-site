I am a final year business student.

The project is to develop a conceptual framework for the development of an e­Supply Chain

Management (e­SCM) System for small­to­medium enterprises (SMEs).The goal is not to

develop the product, rather to envision:

What the product should look like.

What features and functionalities it should have.

What tools could be used to develop the modules of the software system.

What are the commercialisation pathways for such a tool.

development plan. I have no background in software development or programming so i am

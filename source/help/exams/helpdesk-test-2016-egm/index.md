16. Hi all
 I am a final year business student.
 I am currently working on My FYP and have run into difficulty in a particular section.
 The project is to develop a conceptual framework for the development of an e-Supply Chain Management (e-SCM) System for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs).
 The goal is not to develop the product, rather to envision:
    - What the product should look like.
    - What features and functionalities it should have.
    - What tools could be used to develop the modules of the software system.
    - What are the commercialisation pathways for such a tool

	I am having issues with a particular section where I must devise a software development plan. I have no background in software development or programming so i am struggling to understand the requirements.
	I was wondering if it might be possible to meet with a member of your team to talk about the information and requirements for such a task. thank you for your time. (3 marks)

17. Urgent problem. I was trying out the different shells that are on redbrick and I changed mine to /usr/local/shells/disusered. Now when I log in I canâ€™t do anything. Help. (3 marks)

Explain how you would go about doing this. Be as detailed as possible. (3 marks)

19. I just ran `ls -al ~`. Why is my `public_html` directory `lrwxrwxrwx`. Does that mean that my `public_html` dir is writable to everyone? (3 marks)

20. I'm currently using Irssi as my IRC client, and it's kind of okay and stuff. I hear I can use another magical, spectacular client on Redbrick,
what's that all about and how can I switch to it? (3 marks)

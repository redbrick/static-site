G'day, Below are 33 questions, regarding `how do i use redbrick?'. All of these questions are in the form of a mail or a hey from an imaginary user, called Joe Bloggs (jb@redbrick.dcu.ie). **All questions should be answered as if you were replying to him for real**. Each question is worth 3 marks, but you should try to get as much into your answers as possible, as there may be more than one correct answer.

You can assume for the questions, that the user is using the following programs (unless specified otherwise):

*   Email: mutt
*   News: slrn
*   IRC: BitchX

    Hi, Sorry to bother you guys again, but i have a question.

    I just ran ls -al ~. Why is my public_html directory lrwxrwxrwx. Does that mean that my public_html dir is writable to everyone?

    Hi,
      I created a .procmailrc in my home directory and placed this rule into it:

           :0:
           *^(TT|CC|Delivered-To): .*dcu@redbrick.dcu.ie
           .dcue/

      My muttrc contains the following:
        set folder=~/Maildir
        set spoolfile=~/Maildir
        mailboxes =.dcu

      But when i type "mutt" I only see a blank screen, what am i doing wrong?

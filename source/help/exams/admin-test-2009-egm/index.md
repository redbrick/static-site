title: 'Admin Test 2009 EGM'
---

 <sub> - [Helpdesk](../../) - [Joining](../../joining) - [Tutorials](../../tutorials) - [Exams](../../exams) -</sub>
All questions can be answered in the context of any version of UNIX (except for the OpenBSD, Solaris and Linux sections obviously!). Indicating which version of UNIX you refer to in your answer is preferred but not required. Negative marking applies throughout for answers that are clearly incorrect or demonstrate incompetence.

Humourous answers while appreciated gain no extra marks*. **Keep answers short and concise** - don't waste time writing when one or two word answers will suffice.  

<small>* - Although, it will put us in a better mood while correcting.</small>

**ALL SECTIONS ARE *NOT* EQUALLY WEIGHTED**

The test is marked out of an arbitrary number equal to two times the bisection of the set of available marks, as outlined by the numbers beside the questions and sections (they're not just there to look pretty).

### The Rules

*   You ***must*** be mesg n for the duration of the test. Any attempt to communicate with other users will result in immediate disqualification. Big Brother is watching you. Johan has a knife. Sonic **borrowed** Declan's Mace.
*   During the scripting section ***only***, you may refer to the system documentation (man & info pages) for help. You ***may not*** use any external documentation, i.e. no web access! Don't forget, Big Brother is still watching you.
*   You are free to use whatever shell or scripting language you wish to write the scripts (except brainfuck and whitespace. Admins are people too!). Only system commands may be used: yours or other users' scripts ***may not*** be referred to. Basically: No cheating! Big Brother will be checking.
*   Make a directory called ~/admintest, and place scripts and answers in there. Name each script by its question number. Don't forget: Humorous error messages make your scripts run faster. Big Brother likes humorous error messages.

Best of luck!

### scripting

###### 40 marks

1.  Sonic's outputed a list of all the renewed users, but we wanted just the members, not those old associates. Using /var/tmp/list.list send an email to all the members telling them their passwords probably in their spamtrap. (13 Marks)

Redbrick's got a new DAS, So we moving the contents of /storage there, write a script that will copy the contents of /storage to /das/ As it copys each user's files across it should boot the user from the network and disable their account. When the copy completes change the users home dir to the new location and reable there account. Remember, keeping the users informed as you go along is a good idea.(13 marks)
3.  Write a script that will force the user to read the AUP, /var/tmp/aup. After reading the AUP the user should be able to accept, reject or abort the AUP, if the user rejects the AUP make it so they can no longer log in, kick then from the system and email admins. If they abort 3 times email helpdesk asking them to help this user, Each time they abort they should be dissconected. If they accept email committee.

Redbrick offers a great range of services to our members, and we are always looking for more to offer. if you have any ideas, feel free to mail us with your suggestions.

Since 1996, we have been providing people with an excellent, powerful and flexible UNIX environment. We have used Solaris, Linux and FreeBSD, some more than others.

First off, we give you 2GB of disk space by default - having somewhere online to store files and mail is essential these days, especially if you log on from a wide range of locations. We also provide you with your own Email account, and a great range of clients to read/write it with! Procmail and other mail filtering software is installed, so if you feel like it, you can heavily customise mail folders and really make the most of your mail account.

If you're feeling conversational and want to spread the love, you can use hey, an instant message program that lets you send messages to other users. You can also use the UNIX talk service for some one-on-one action. Our very own IRC server is great for meeting new people online, having group discussions, or just blabbing to the general Redbrick populace about your latest grievance.

Many people love to code, you can log on to Pygmalion, our development server, which has every compiler under the sun installed, and if you find we don't have the one that you need, let us know and we will try help you out. You should always back up your code. What better way to do this then with a distributed source code management system. We have git installed on Redbrick so have a look [here](https://wiki.redbrick.dcu.ie/mw/Git) at how to get started.


You can read more about the various services we offer in their respective sections:

## Wiki
Login and edit wiki.redbrick.dcu.ie as you learn. The Redbrick Wiki was made by users for users. In turn, it is to be maintained by users, so if you find any information out of date, feel free to update it. The wiki is all encompassing in realtion to all things Redbrick, it's pretty much our "How To Redbrick" guide. Login, edit and learn to your heart's content!

## Mail
Once you have your username and password you can use the webmail service we offer on Redbrick. Mail from your Redbrick address auto goes to your DCU email. This can stop by typing ```forward off``` in terminal on Redbrick, but we don't now why you'd want to do a thng like that. Read more about webmail [here](https://wiki.redbrick.dcu.ie/mw/Webmail).

## Hosting
We currently offer 2 different types of web hosting:
*   http://[username].redbrick.dcu.ie/ - user vhosting is our default hosting, if you like, you can also have your site accessible, at [something].redbrick.dcu.ie, usually your username. All you have to do is Email the webmaster and ask.
*   http://www.something.com/ - full vhosting, members can also have full virtual hosts on redbrick, where the hostname is that of a domain you own, all you have to do is Email the Webmaster and get your DNS provider to point the domain at our IP address. We also ask that users who have virtual hosts link their site to our homepage.

## HackMD

Redbrick hosts HackMD, a multiplatform collaborative markdown note editor which allows the creation of realtime markdown notes on all platforms. 

It's real time that means you can write and edit notes with your peers at the same time. As you write, you can view he changes you make in HackMD's split screen view. Needless to say, it works very uniquely, all you have to do is to write an article over there and if you need any corrections or additions from your peers, then you can send them that article's web URL and they can edit and rewrite it as they think fit plus an original copy will always remain with you.

Check out HackMD at [md.redbrick.dcu.ie](md.redbrick.dcu.ie).

## Mastodon
Mastodon is a federated social network which shares similarities to Twitter, but differs from Twitter in how it is administrated as a decentralized federation of servers running open source software. Basically Mastodon takes the best part from Twitter, and then it does it a little better.

The distributed, open-source platform offers better tools for privacy and fighting harassment than Twitter offers, but coupled with this is a steep learning curve. Mastodon’s federated nature means there’s no single website to use, and learning how to sift through its timeline of toots can take some time.

If you miss "the old Twitter”, i.e the days of purely chronological timelines and no ads, Mastodon is perfect for you! You can find Mastodon hosted on Redbrick at mastodon.redbrick.dcu.ie/.


## Hastebin
Ever hear of a pastebin? It's just like that, except you're in a hurry! Hastebin is a service we host for storing and sharing text and code snippets with your peers.

Paste your code, markdown or whatever you feel like pasting into the provided space. After that, just save it, get your link and then share it!

Try out Hastebin at [paste.redbrick.dcu.ie](paste.redbrick.dcu.ie).

The Christmas season is upon us, and wih the final week of this semester beginning, Redbrick are taking it easy in preparation for the holidays. As always though, there's something happening!

*   Movie Night
*   Downtime
*   Merry Christmas

## Movie Night

This Tuesday, the 13th of December, Redbrick in association with Strange Things will be hosting a movie night! Come along at 6pm to Q120 to see "Rare Exports - A Christmas Tale". Refreshments will be provided, and it's the perfect excuse for taking a break from all those assignments and study!

## Downtime

We regret to inform you Redbrick will be experiencing downtime on December 21st and December 29th due to ISS network outages. Services will be unavailable all day both days, but should be as normal for most of the holidays!

## Merry Christmas

Finally, the committee of Redbrick would like to wish our members all the best for the Christmas season. This last semester flew, and we have you, the members, to thank for making it so awesome. Thank you guys - Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and we'll see you next semester!

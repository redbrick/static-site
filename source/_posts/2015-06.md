Hey all,

Regrettably the talk scheduled for this evening on interviews and
presentations has been cancelled. It will be rescheduled at some point in
the coming weeks.

However, our Halloween drinks are still going ahead! Meet us at 7pm in The
Slipper. You can dress up as something scary (~zergless), something sexy
(~cac), your Blueblock alter ego (~theboy), or even yourself - bonus
points for wearing computing equipment as clothing. I look forward to
seeing you there!


Don't forget to risk a peek at our social media pages and jam-packed
society calendar:

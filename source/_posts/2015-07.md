Hey all,

With a heavy heart and an uncontrollable fit of giggles I'm sorry to say
that our beloved Gillian (socks) has resigned from her position as
treasurer. That means we get to have the fun of holding an EGM next
Thursday (2/12/15) to vote in a new treasurer! Time will be confirmed in
the next few days.

If you are interested in running for the position, please email the
committee. The treasurer is expected to be well organised, and to have a
deep passion for filling in forms weekly.

Look forward to seeing you there on Thursday!

Best regards from myself and the rest of committee,

Noah Donnelly (cac)
1st Year Computational Problem Solving & Software Development
Redbrick Secretary 2015/16

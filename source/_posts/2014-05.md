Hey all,

As there's been a lot of interest from you talented folks in the position
of webmaster I've decided to resign and will be running for one of the open
admin positions at the EGM on the 22nd. The more talented and enthusiastic
folks we have on  committee the better!

As such I'll be holding the webmaster exam some time next week! Please
email me by 5pm on Monday to register your interest in taking the exam.

The exam will probably be Tuesday/Thursday next week.

Your friendly neighbourhood webmaster,

Rob.

Hi everyone,

We'll be doing an update on Pygmalion on Tuesday 16th September 7pm.

Please be aware that the server will be available from 6:45 p.m.
We estimate this update will only take 30 mins.

We hope to have restored Pygmalion's service completely by 7:30 p.m.

Regards,

Richard Walsh (koffee)

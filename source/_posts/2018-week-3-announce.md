## Microsoft Talk - Why (almost) everything is worse at Scale. And why that’s Good

To solve problems that affect billions of people, you need to think about them in a different way. This talk will follow how we use the scale of Microsoft to empower the lives of all of our users, including how the scale affects how we go about solving issues, testing for it and how we monitor for issues.

Eoin O'Brien has been a software engineer in Microsoft Office for over 2 years currently driving knowledge from insights on the One Microsoft Enterprise Acceleration team. Eoin has worked on services, data processing and publicly facing websites, including working on both the consumer and enterprise side of Office, driving growth and adoption.
Come along and see what this great talk has to offer, meet some great industry professionals and maybe learn something new!

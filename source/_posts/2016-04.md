Evenin' All,

Just a quick word to let you know that we'll be doing some upgrade works
(physical and application) on servers this weekend. We'll, probably, be
starting at 11a.m. on Saturday give or take a few minutes.

All servers will be affected by these updates and we'll be stopping
services and  doing cascading updates.

Apologies for any inconvenience caused.

Regards,

Richard Walsh (koffee)

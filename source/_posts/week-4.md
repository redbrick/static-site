======================
We've had to postpone this as we have admin exams at 6pm.
So we're going to reschedule for next week and change up the movie to the cheesy
1995 classic "Hackers" Sorry for the inconvenience, we'll make sure you guys get
all of next week's details sooner. We're still ironing out a few bugs on this
end.

==================
{% image nocaption right intercom.png intercom%}
This week we see another company come to pay us a visit; this week it's
Intercom.
Intercom has only recently had its 3rd birthday, yet it's making huge a serious
impact on how companies deal with their customers. Intercom have had developers,
engineers and business join them from companies as big as Amazon and
Google. Come along on Thursday and see how Intercom do what they do, and
what it's like to work for them.

We've got:
Brian White and Brian Long (make sure to call him Robin) coming to talk
about running Intercom.
Matthew Barrington will be fanboying to the extreme about his time with
Intercom.

This should be a great evening, for anyone that may have been at the
inside intercom meetings throughout the year you know how interesting and
enthusiastic the Intercomrades are; for those who haven't you should
definitely come along and witness it first hand.

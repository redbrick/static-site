##Intro to Git

Git is a word you're going to hear a lot. But what is git? What can it do? How can you use it?

Well if you want to learn more, come along to LG25 on Wednesday the 18th of October at 15:00 where Stephen Blott will give a talk on the wondrous world of git.

Stephen has given fantastic talks in the past on git and we are thrilled to have him in to introduce people to a very important part of software development.

Come on down to LG25 next Wednesday at 15:00 to "git" good at git!

##HackerClub

We will step through the basics of competitive programming, helping you understand how you should interpret the question and to understand STDIN and STDOUT. We will have questions of various difficulties, even for beginners, so relax. In case you are hungry we will give you pizza to boost your algorithms by O(n^2)! In the second hour we will run some harder problems, so you can release your inner programming beast. Come to L101 at 16:00 on Thursday for 2 hour session of fun!

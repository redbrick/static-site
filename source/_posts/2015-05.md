This week the Helpdesk team will go through how to set up a Virtual
Machine (VM) & a basic Linux install and configuration.
They'll be on hand to answer questions as the tutorial goes. Make sure to
turn up if you want to pester Helpdesk like I do.

On Thursday we have the lovely Lotta Mikkonen (attol) coming in to talk to
us about interview techniques and 3 & 4 project presentation. This talk
will be great for everybody especially those of you with intra interviews
and projects coming up. You should definitely come along as she'll be
passing on some invaluable tips on acing those interviews!

We'll also be heading out for Halloween drinks afterwards at the Slipper!
See below.

## Halloween Drinks!
 - Date: Thursday 29/10/15
 - Time: 6.30pm
 - Location: The Slipper
The only thing better than practising interview techniques is practising
them under the influence of alcohol! After Lotta's talk on Thursday, we'll
be heading to The Slipper for some Halloween drinks and festive
tomfoolery. Fancy dress is optional, but warmly welcomed!

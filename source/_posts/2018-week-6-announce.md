Hello again everyone!


It's me again branch your secretary, I hope you all enjoyed last week and our great talk from our friends at Mastercard and our weekly Hackerclub event. Just a few bits of info for everyone. There will be a planned restart of the IRC this weekend to load config changes, We just want to apologize to anyone that might be affected by this restart. For anyone who went to our talk with Mastercard last week they are looking for feedback (good and bad) and they'd love to know what anyone who was lucky enough to grab a pi is planning on doing with them, If you have any feedback please just send it right along to us on committee.

This week is still set to be jam packed with stuff for all you brickies to come along and enjoy, especially seen as we have another great talk coming from our Helpdesk this week on Linux. Keep reading to find out more!

## Fosdem Signups

Yep it's back our trip to Belgium and to FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting - a mouthful I know) is here again. This year we want to have as many brickies come along with us as possible, so we've opened up our signups for anyone who wants to join us.

It was an amazing event last year, my first time going and despite not being able to remember some parts of it, I had an unbelievable time learned loads and coming away so much better for it. I hope to see loads of you come along this year and experience some overseas fun with Redbrick!


So if you think going off to Belgium for a few days to experience Brussels and to take part in one of the largest software engineering meetups in Europe sounds fun sign up with the Typeform down below.

## Hackerclub

Are you finding programming hard? Little bit stuck or at a point where you’re too afraid to ask questions? Never fear! Hackerclub is back and better than ever!
Come along down to L101 Thursday at 5pm to find out what it’s all about and maybe learn a few new things about tackling those pesky programming problems!

Firstly we'd like to thank everyone who came along to the Tech University Open House in Google HQ last Friday, we hope you ad a great day!

Now on to the good stuff, what's coming up this week you say?

We'll have 3 talks as follows. We can guarantee you these talks are fantastic having heard from two of the speakers on Friday!

We'd recommend coming along and bringing anyone even a little bit curious as to how Google goes about its daily routine. Bring your friends, bring your mum, heck... even bring your cat!! We've been looking forward to these talks for quite some time and we hope you enjoy them!

Last of the talks for this week is one of our annual talks the annual:

We will cover: Who's who in the committee. What each committee member does. What Redbrick has to offer - an intro by our Education Officer. What's planned for the rest of the year.

So it's the beginning of another year and we've got an awful lot going on. We have the new website and branding completed over the summer and we have some great things lined up for the next few months.

There are 2 main goals of the year. The first is to keep doing what we do best but make that even better. The second is to do some events and talks to try and gain as many new members as possible. We've got some great talks lined up from some good speakers and we have some ideas for some new and improved services over the next few months.

Watch this space.

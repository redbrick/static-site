## SISTEM - Student's Inter-Society Tech & Enterprise Meetup

SISTEM is a meetup style conference run by students, for students. We hope SISTEM helps provide a link between students and those in the world of tech and enterprise in a casual meetup environment.

Redbrick DCU, DUCSS, DIT Compsoc and DU Netsoc have come together to organise the tech event of the year! Those involved in organising SISTEM are undergraduates, and they recognised the lack of an event in Ireland that targets topics in a way that doesn’t leave students with heavy eyes & boggled minds.

We hope this conference helps provide a link between students and those in the world of tech and enterprise in a casual meetup environment.

SISTEM will take place on the 24th of March 2018 at The Innovation Academy. The conference will start at 9:00 AM and conclude around 5:00 PM that day. During the conference, there will be speakers from an array of different companies as well as workshops and lightning talks.

We have a very exciting list of speakers and workshops that will be announced shortly, as will ticket sales. Tickets will be selling at €10 per person.

## BASH: Seizing the Memes of Production

Bash is a scripting language widely used for automating day-to-day tasks, like backups, software updates, and email alerts. However, we think we can do better.

Come on down to LG26 at 3pm sharp on Wednesday the 21st for a workshop where we build our own meme generator script! We'll cover conditions, I/O redirection, and all the other things that go into serving up a spicy meme.

## B.Y.O.P
Redbrick's weekly workshop, Build Your Own Projects is on again! Running in L128 on Thursday from 16:00 to 18:00 this week, BYOP is a workshop focused on project-based learning, i.e applying what you already know to projects.

## Google Hash Code
Step into the shoes of a Google engineer during Hash Code, a team programming competition that tasks students and professionals across Europe, the Middle East and Africa with solving a Google engineering problem. Are you up for the challenge? The first round (an Online Qualification Round) is on 1st March at 18:30 CET.

You can take part from anywhere you'd like, or you can participate in one of the Hash Code hubs. DCU's School of Computing is once again a Hash Code hub, providing a fun and exciting environment where teams compete side-by-side.

Top scoring teams from this round will be invited to Google Dublin to compete for the title of Hash Code 2018 champion.

## IrlCPC
The 2018 Irish Collegiate Programming Competition will be held on Saturday the 10th of March in UCC. If you intend to travel down with Redbrick to IrlCPC, please emailcommittee@redbrick.dcu.ie as soon as possible as we can give 50% off to the first seven teams that sign up to travel with us.

If you're thinking of entering, head on over to http://acm.ucc.ie/node/add/registration to register your team!

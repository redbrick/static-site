Well here we are in Week 3 already. How the hell did that happen? It has been a hectic week signing up all our new members and getting the Freshers ball sorted. But now I'd like to talk about what we're doing with the feedback we've received from members so far.

As most of you know, we've asked members to fill out a survey with some questions about Redbrick and the direction they want to see it go. I personally have been pretty surprised with how much effort some members have gone to to give their opinions and criticisms. All are greatly appreciated. So this year, as well as admin training, we will also be running programming workshops every other week. These will either be run by our own admin team or by guest speakers. An awful lot of people asked us for more programming related talks and a lot of people specifically asked for extra help in programming. Well we heard you and we're making it happen. Keep your eyes on the weekly announce for more information on that.

Finally, we've been getting tonnes of feedback for the new site which has been extremely helpful. We know there are a few little things here and there that need to be done but we're working hard on getting it all sorted. As some of you may have noticed, Webmail has received a makeover. We are now back to running Roundcube. The boards are being themed in the coming weeks and you may notice a few little UI tweaks around the site as well.

If you have any feedback at all please [contact the committee](/about/contact/committee) and let us know.

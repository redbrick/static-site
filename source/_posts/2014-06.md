Good afternoon Everyone,

First of all, we'd like to apologise for the late announce! It 
shouldn't happen again!
The evenings are getting shorter as we head into week 4.
This week we're filling this shortening evenings with some great 
events.
It's all about quality, not quantity.

Without further ado the agenda for the week is as follows:
 - Screen at Redbrick
 - Associate Talks
 - Helpdesk Talks
 - Intercom at Redbrick

 <!-- more -->

## Screen at Redbrick
We've had to postpone this as we have admin exams at 6pm.
So we're going to reschedule for next week and change up the movie to 
the cheesy 1995 classic "Hackers"
Sorry for the inconvenience, we'll make sure you guys get all of next 
week's details sooner.
We're still ironing out a few bugs on this end.

##Intercom at Redbrick
This week we see another company come to pay us a visit; this week
it's Intercom.
Intercom has only recently had its 3rd birthday, yet it's making huge a 
serious impact on how companies deal with their customers.
Intercom have had developers, engineers and business join them from 
companies as big as Amazon and Google.
Come along on Thursday and see how Intercom do what they do, and what 
it's like to work for them.
We've got:
Brian White and Brian Long (make sure to call him Robin) coming to
talk about running Intercom.
Matthew Barrington will be fanboying to the extreme about his time
with Intercom.
This should be a great evening, for anyone that may have been at the 
inside intercom meetings throughout the year you know how interesting 
and enthusiastic the Intercomrades are; for those who haven't you should 
definitely come along and witness it first hand.

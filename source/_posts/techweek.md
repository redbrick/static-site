DCU President Brian MacCraith will be powering on this exciting week as DCU embraces a celebration of all things Technology.

There will be inspiring talks covering a world wide web of topics delivered by the best in the Tech Industry. Companies such as Amazon, Openet and Symantec will be providing an excellent opportunity for students to get a real feel for the places they can go in the tech field.

We have a coding competition run by Openet with uber prizes up to 1000 euros. Last year 5 students also got job offers as a result this event, it's not to be missed!

Amazon will be blessing us with their expert insightful talks and will also be providing an opportunity to meet and greet with the experts in an informal environment, were students can ask questions and exchange their CVs :)

Symantec will be delivering some very high-caliber talks, giving students an insider view of what its like to work on a Malware threat response team within Symantec.

We have a large array of other inspirational talks spanning 3D Modelling, Web/Mobile Development, Security and Raspberry pi projects. Hopefully covering all the bases and filling you with technical lust for the hacker culture within which we live. I hope you are as excited as we are!

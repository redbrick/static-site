If you're not going to PyCon, and if you're interested in some hardcore
problem-solving, maybe I'll see you at the UKIEPC hosted in DCU on
Saturday. Competitive programming is a great way to up your skills, and
looks great on the CV.

Google are sponsoring the DCU competition, and there will be goodies
galore, including Chromecasts for the top 3 teams. Lunch will be provided.
You can still register a team (2-3 people) until this Wednesday, the 21st.

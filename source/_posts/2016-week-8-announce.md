Dear Redbrick Crew,

We're already up to week 8 which means we're two thirds of the way through semester 1. To energise you for the final third, Redbrick has got some hopping things going on:

 <!-- more -->

## Bash Scripting with Helpdesk:
- When: Wednesday 9th, 3-4pm.
- Where: LG25
- More information here: https://www.facebook.com/events/1805312056375861/

Time to learn some bash with Redbrick's very own Bonnie and Clyde-esque helpdesk.
Get some scripts going to make those repetitive tasks that much easier, maybe get some programs up and running at start-up or just make backing up that much nicer!

## AIB Data Hack:
- When: Saturday 12th
- Where: AIB Bankcentre, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4
- More information here: https://www.aibdatahack.com/

This weekend AIB is holding two 12 hour events simultaneously, a Datathon and a Hackathon. There's loads of prizes for the best teams and good buzz all-round.

## Buying a Laptop:
- When: Tuesday 15th, 5-6pm
- Where: LG25
- More information here: https://www.facebook.com/events/574819529368242/

Lorcan (zergless) is doing a talk on what to look into when buying a laptop, this will be especially helpful for people looking to get the most of their money while still getting the laptop they need.

## FOSDEM:
- When: 4th & 5th February 2017
- Where: Brussels, Belgium
- Registration: http://events.redbrick.dcu.ie/fosdem/

Should you wish to join Redbrick on our trip to Brussels for FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting), a two day event filled with loads of talks, hacking sessions, open discussions and much much more, please sign up ASAP as there are very few spaces remaining.

If you bought tickets to go to PyCon this past weekend, could you please email our treasurer Ross (sully - email: sully@redbrick.dcu.ie) about potential rebate.
Also as a reminder, Github offer a free student pack that is packed to the brim with cool stuff that you might need at some point (why turn down free domains and hosting amirite). The link to all the free stuff is: https://education.github.com/pack
That's it from me this week - I hope you have a great week and I'll hopefully see all of you around?

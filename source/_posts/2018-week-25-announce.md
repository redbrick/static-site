## Ancient Brain Bug Bounty
DCU Lecturer Mark Humphrys want to recruit some white hat hackers for a "bug bounty" scheme, and he thought Redbrick would be a good place to start!

Mark will be coming in to talk to us about finding bugs and exploits in his site, Ancient Brain. Each valid exploit or bug comes with a generous cash reward, so come along to LG26 at 15:00 on Wednesday the 7th of March to find out how you can help stress-test his site!

More info can be found at https://ancientbrain.com/bugs.php

## Jobs Board Survey

Here at Redbrick we sometimes hear about different jobs that might be of interest to our members. As a committee we want to hear what our members think about the idea of a jobs board as one of our services.

We have made a typeform survey to gather your opinions.
We would really appreciate it if you could fill it out!

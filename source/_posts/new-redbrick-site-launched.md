Well here it is. Just a few hours later than scheduled the new Redbrick site is up and ready for you to explore. And we need you to do just that.

<!-- more -->
We're delighted with the new site as we hope you are too, but it's not finished yet. We have big plans to integrate a new events system as well as some other cool new features which we'll be talking about over the next few weeks. In the mean time, please explore the new site and [report anything that seems a bit borked](mailto:vadimck@redbrick.dcu.ie) to our webmaster VadimCK.

Bye for now!

## Mastercard Tech Talks - Wednesday @3pm CG86

On Wednesday the 24th of October Redbrick are fortunate enough to be hosting Mastercard for a session of really great lightning talks.
The subject of these riveting talks include : Augmented Reality, Computer Visualisation, Blockchain, Scalable Infrastructure and Payments Security. So loads for everyone to sink their teeth into.
The new shorter format is sure to keep these "tech talks" interesting, educational and concise. Be sure to join us at CG86 (a.k.a "The Pitt") for informative talks, free food, prizes and the chance to walk home with your very own iPad courtesy of Mastercard.
Come along and see what these great talks have to offer, meet some great industry professionals and maybe learn some great new things

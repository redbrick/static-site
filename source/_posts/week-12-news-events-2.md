It may be the last week, but the Redbrick committee still have a few things to say. Firstly, we would like to wish good luck to everyone taking exams in the coming weeks, and best of luck for the future to all the fourth years, we hope to see them return as associate members next year.  

Here's what's happening this week.

*   Pre-Exam Pints
*   Daniel Downtime
*   Moving Murphy

## Pre-Exam Pints
{% image nocaption right BarsPints.jpg BarsPints%}

As it's the end of the year, we think that we should all reflect on the past year, and what better way than with a few pints? We plan to head to the NuBar for around 6:30pm on Tuesday the 24th. It'll be a great chance to chill out and catch up before the exams begin.

## Daniel Downtime

On Friday the 27th of April at around 3pm the admins will be applying security updates to Daniel, our virtual machine server. We recommend that you shut-down your VMs before this, to prevent any loss of your work.

The Admins apologies for any inconvenience caused.

## Moving Murphy

Murphy, our former web server, is being moved from the server room in the Hub to the basement of the Library. We intend to use Murphy as a back-up server, in the case of loss of power to the Hub (affecting the servers in the server room there). Murphy will be taken off-line this Friday during Daniels updates so it can be prepared for the move to the basement. We recommend moving any scripts and programs you may be running to Morpheus or Azazel by this time.

Once again, the admin team would like to apologise for any inconveniences caused.

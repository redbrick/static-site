{% image nocaption right shdd-rb.jpg shdd-rb%} ## Admin Training

This week sees the return of admin training! For those that attended, we'll be continuing from the topics we covered last semester.

This weeks topic will be on Installing an Ubuntu server, so be sure to come along, even just for a nose about. We'll be starting at 6pm in LG25 on Tuesday the 28th.

## Science Hackday Dublin

Science Hackday Dublin will the held on the weekend of the 3rd and 4th of March. The event starts at 9am on the Saturday, and ends at 6pm on the Sunday.

## Techweek 2012

Techweek makes its return for 2012! Starting on the 5th of March, it's sure to be a week full of fun, techy events. We'll fill you in on what's happening next weekend.

## Chromebook Testing

Redbrick and Engineering Soc have received 30 Chromebooks to distribute to its members for testing. This is only open to members of either society, but is a fantastic opportunity to try out this brand new, top of the range technology - and to give your feedback on it!

You will be responsible for the Chromebook for the remainder of the semester and will be required to fill out a 5 minute survey at the end of the trial, with the possibility of winning a prize.

If this sounds good to you, email either the [redbrick committee](/about/contact/committee) or dcuengineeringsoc@gmail.com for a form. Closing date is Friday the 2nd of March.

Hey everyone.  
We'd all like to welcome all our incoming first years to DCU, welcome to university! We will be meeting you during Fresher's week, and again on Clubs and Societies Days.

We're currently planning our first few events of the year, including our Introduction to Redbrick Talk, and the Fresher's Ball! Both of these are a fantastic opportunity to meet fellow students from all years, and make friends that will last through the years. As one of DCU's oldest societies, we can help you settle into college life, and show you how important society life is to your college experience.

Be sure to check out our Facebook group and our Wiki, and we look forward to meeting you very soon!

We will be announcing details for the first few weeks back within the next fortnight.

w00t!

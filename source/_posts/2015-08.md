Join us on Tuesday as Gary Conway, the organiser of the All-Ireland
Programming Olympiad and a DCU computing department sysadmin, gives us an
introduction to competitive programming. He'll cover what's involved, how
to get started, and will have loads of time for a good old-fashioned Q&A.
If you want to learn how to bolster our CV with competitive programming
feats, or jet off to exotic places to compete in exciting contests, then
come to this talk to figure out what's what!

Not completely scared off JavaScript after last week? Fair play to you!
Well then let's try this again, this week come on down to LG25 again for
Advanced JavaScript (with maybe a few of the basics that we missed last
week) with one of our helpful elves (also known as admins) voy! He'll be
taking us on a magical journey through the mysterious void that is object
orientated programming. Topics include objects, prototyping and (more)
async!

With a heavy heart and an uncontrollable fit of giggles I'm sorry to say
that our beloved Gillian (socks) has resigned from her position as
treasurer. That means we get to have the fun of holding an EGM this
Thursday to vote in a new treasurer!

If you are interested in running for the position, please email the
committee. The treasurer is expected to be well organised, and to have a
deep passion for filling in forms weekly.

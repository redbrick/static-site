Dear Redbrick Crew,

My name is Oskar and I'm your new bad-boy secretary.
My first action as secretary is to inform you of all the events and goings
on happening in Redbrick. Let’s hit it.

##EGM:
Redbrick held its EGM on Wednesday, electing a new committee and coming to
the conclusion that pineapple on pizza is a-okay.
The new additions to the committee are as follows:
- Admin - Cormac Smartt (pints)
- First year rep - George Burac (georgey)
- Helpdesk - Tom Doyle (greenday)
- Helpdesk - Dylan McDonald (grace)
- Public Relations Officer - Senan Kelly (sentriz)
- Secretary - Oskar McDermott (oskar)
- Webmaster - Cian Butler (butlerx)

##UKIEPC:
- When: Actual event Saturday 29th October 11am – 4pm
- Registration: 26th October
- Where: Hosted in DCU School of Computing

The UKIEPC is the UK & Ireland Intercollegiate Programming Competition run
in the DCU School of Computing, sponsored by Arista, in which
undergraduate students are given five hours to solve ten problems of
varying difficulties.
Prizes for top 3 Irish UKIEPC teams are:

1. Trip to Bath to compete in the NWERC programming competition
2. €300 Amazon voucher
3. €150 Amazon voucher
It’s free and apparently there’s t-shirts and pizzas (not sure about
whether or not they’re with pineapple) given to the entrants so I would
definitely recommend coming.

##Intro to Linux:

- Where: LG25

Have you ever wondered how to install Linux but not lose your precious
Windows or Mac OS?

Have you ever wanted something you were not afraid to break?

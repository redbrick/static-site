## Interpints

This coming Friday (16th of February) is Interpints! Interpints is a somewhat cool name for a bunch of the networking societies around the city getting together and mingling to their herts content over a few drinks.

Everyone is welcome to come, it's always fun to meet new like-minded people and an inter-society event is the perfect place to do it!

Societies present at interpints:
Redbrick, DU Netsoc, DIT CompSoc, and DUCSS.

We hope to meet up in Alfie Byrne's at around 7:00pm on Friday.

See you then!

## Automate & Chill

No plans for Valentine's Day yet? Rather eat pizza and find out how to make your life a little less hectic? Well then LG26 is where you need to be at 15:00 on Wednesday the 14th my friend!

Over the past few months, some of the current Redbrick committee members have found ways to automate certain aspects of their roles. On Wednesday we look at what they've done and how you can apply it to your own jobs.

No one likes having to do the same thing over and over again, so come along to LG26 on Wednesday at 15:00 and start eliminating the tedious day-to-day tasks from your life!

## HackerClub

Finding programming hard? At a point where you are too afraid to ask for help?

Never fear - HackerClub is here!

Come along to L101 on Tuesdays at 16:00 to improve your programming skills by solving competitive programming problems. Practice makes perfect right?

People who attended HackerClub last semester improved more and more with each passing week, but most of all, they became increasingly confident in their code. HackerClub is run by people who know how chaotic it is as a newbie programmer, so this kind of development and growth is very important to us.

Pop along to L101 at or indeed between 16:00 to 18:00 on a Tuesday this semester Rest assured that Redbrick will be there to help out!

## B.Y.O.P

Welcome to Redbrick's brand new weekly workshop, Build Your Own Projects! Running in L128 on Thursday from 16:00 to 18:00 this week, BYOP is a workshop focused on project based learning, i.e applying what you already know to projects.

Along the way you will show you some handy tools you can use to enhance and improve your projects.

So have a brainstorm and then come on down on Thursday and pick up some new skills as you build!

## Google Hash Code

Step into the shoes of a Google engineer during Hash Code, a team programming competition that tasks students and professionals across Europe, the Middle East and Africa with solving a Google engineering problem. Are you up for the challenge? The first round (an Online Qualification Round) is on 1st March at 18:30 CET.

You can take part from anywhere you'd like, or you can participate in one of the Hash Code hubs. DCU's School of Computing is once again a Hash Code hub, providing a fun and exciting environment where teams compete side-by-side.

Top scoring teams from this round will be invited to Google Dublin to compete for the title of Hash Code 2018 champion.

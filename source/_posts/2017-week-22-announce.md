Dear Redbrick friends,

We're ploughing through the academic year. With 22 weeks gone, here's
what's still to come:

# Admin Talk: Setting up a Server for Fun and Profit

- When: Wednesday 15th, 3-4pm
- Where: LG26
- More information here: https://www.facebook.com/events/606208012923445/

Have you ever started your own billion dollar social network only to
realise you don't have space in your tiny bedroom for racks on racks of
servers?
You're not the only one! Luckily, with a special talk from pints and
zergless, you'll finally get to figure out how to avoid an appearance on
Makeover: Home Edition and learn how to host your web-servers on other
peoples' computers.

SIDE-NOTE: if you have anything you would like to hear a talk about,
please let us know! We're always into fresh new ideas.

# Google #HashCode 2017

- When: Thursday 23rd, 5-9pm
- Where: LG25
- More information here: https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/

Once again, DCU School of Computing will be a Hub for Google's HashCode
competition.

The online Qualification Round will take place in LG25 on Thursday 23rd
February 5-9pm.
Hash Code is open to university students and industry professionals in
Europe, the Middle
East and Africa. Participants compete in teams of two to four.

Registration is free of charge and will close on 20th February 2017 at
17:00 GMT.

# Hoodies
Finally, Redbrick is making hoodies!
If you're interested in some primo-nice-cool-trendy-zip-up-hoodies, fill
out your interest here: http://hoodies.redbrick.dcu.ie/
They'll cost around 35 euros and will have a logo on the chest and the
back and if you want you can get your name on the sleeve.
You have until the end of the month to register.

See you soon,
- Oskar McDermott (oskar)

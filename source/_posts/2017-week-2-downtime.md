## Downtime Over Weekend

Redbrick will be going down for maintenance this Sunday, at 1pm, for approximately 2 hours. This is to facilitate updates to our hosts, and a general health check on the network. All services will be affected, and logins will be disabled prior to the shutdown. If you have any questions, please contact admins@redbrick.dcu.ie

## Webspace Setup

Webspace was originally at 16:00 today, but due to unforeseen circumstances, we've had to move it an hour earlier. Webspace is now at 16:00 in L114. Our webmaster will show you how to upload any* file to your website so you can show your friends how awesome you are!

## Competitive Programming Practice Evening

We wanted Webspace Setup and our Practice evening to run back to back, so when Webspace changed, this in turn had to change. Our practice evening is now at 17:00 (not really evening time) in L114. Come to brush up on your skills, chill with some brickies and of course, indulge in some pizza.

## Microsoft Programming Competition

Redbrick and Microsoft are teaming up to bring you some competitive programming funsies on October 11th! If you want to be in with the chance of winning some swag you better pop along to LG25 at 15:00, we have prizes for the top three teams, with the top team winning a €100 One4all gift voucher for each member. If that wasn't enough for you, there's even an Xbox One being raffled. Incentives galore.

Teams can have between 1 - 3 people, you can use any too/language you want and there's no restrictions in terms of internet. The competition is more geared for second year students and above, but don't let that discourage you if you're a first year! Pop along and see what competitive programming is like!

The room is LG25 and the date is Wednesday 11th of October and the time is 15:00, come along and join us for some good old fashioned problem solving, programming, and pizza.

## Engineering & Computing Ball

The Engineering and Redbrick societies have been working hard over the past few months to bring you one of the top highlights of the year!
It will take place on Thursday, November 16th, in The Bonnington Hotel(formerly The Regency Hotel Dublin), on the Swords road. The events runs something like this: Prosecco reception, three course banquet, a band, and finally a DJ.

Concession tickets are €45 and the standard tickets are €50. If you want to avail of the concession ticket price and save yourself a fiver (the cost of goujons and chips in NuBar) all you have to do is pay a €10 deposit before the end of the week to any committee member from either Redbrick or EngSoc.

## FOSDEM

In short, FOSDEM is the biggest European meetup of developers, and Redbrick is going. If you like hanging around a big convention talking about open source software with nerds, this is the place for you!
FOSDEM will be held in Brussels on the 3rd & 4th or February 2018. Redbrick will be flying out to Belgium on the evening of the 2nd and returning on the evening of the 4th. So far all we can say is that the overall price will be less than €100, that includes flights and accommodation by the way.
If you're interested, sign up at the link below, places are limited and it's pretty much first come first served.

Intercom are a growing force in CRM; with Engineers and designers coming

bound to be doing something right. Some of the Redbrick committee have gone
to see their "Inside Intercom" talks, and now we're bringing them to us. We
have two Associate members confirmed thus far; moju and singer, they'll
coming in to talk about how Intercom runs and their times at the company
thus far.

To get a feel for the kind of company it is check out their blog here:

## Associates:

So far we've had a huge response from our associate members, who are keen to
share their knowledge and interests with the rest of the society.
Confirmed so far are talks from:

   - Cian Synnott (pooka) - Find some of his tech writing here: emauton.org
   - Diarmaid McManus (elephant)
   - Ciar?n McNally (mak)
   - Richard Dalton (d_fens)
   - Matthew Barrington (moju)
   - David Scanlan (singer)

With many more who haven't been adequately 'persuaded' yet.

This is just a taster of what we've got lined up for the year, along with
the annual Christmas party, Quiz, Tech Week and Super Secret Trip, we hope
you'll enjoy the year.

## Clubs&Socs Days
### When: Sept 29th-Oct 1st
It's that time of the year when we herald in a new gen of members.(Gen20 by
my count)
As usual there'll be Redbrick committee members floating around the Venue,
Giving out goodies and chatting about the year to come to all and sundry.
Anyone can come by and renew their membership over those 3 days.


## Updates
### When: Sept-Nov
Over the next few months the admins, helped by esteemed rootholders, will
be undertaking updates of the whole Redbrick Network.
We will of course endeavour to give everyone plenty of notice of member
impacting updates.
Minimising  downtime is one of our biggest priorities, so we'll endeavour
to make any necessary
downtime as quick and painless and restore services as soon as possible.


That's all until next week.

We hope to see as many of you as possible at events throughout the year,

On behalf of Redbrick Committee,

Richard Walsh

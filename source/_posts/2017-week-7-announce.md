## Microsoft @ Redbrick
### Wednesday | 15:30 | LG26

Microsoft are back again! Last time Microsoft came in we had a fantastic coding
competition, and now they're back to talk to us.

What's the talk? They'll be telling us about how they deliver services to their
Office Customers on a day to day basis.

Sign up here, so we know how much pizza to order:

Come along to LG26 on the first day of November at 15:30. Redbrick, Microsoft
and pizza is turning out to be quite the combination.

See y'all there!

## Hackerclub
### Thursday | 4pm | L101

Hackerclub will be continuing as usual this Thursday, starting at 4pm.

Come on down to practice your programming, eat pizza, and chat with us!

We'll be working through some less-demanding problems until 5pm, and then we'll
step up the difficulty for the brave amongst you!

## Mid-Semester Drinks
### Thursday | 7pm | Nubar

It's reading week, and that means there's less people around than usual. Some
of your friends may have gone home for the week, some may actually be hitting
the books, but your friends at Redbrick won't let you down!

Redbrick wil host a mid-semester party in the NuBar next Thursday starting at
19:00.

Feel free to pop down at any time, it's a great opportunity to get to know
other members and the committee!

## Committee Changes

At our EGM last week, we elected new members to our committee to fill the roles of Secretary, Helpdesk and System Administrator. We’d like to welcome Niall Gaffney (gamma) and Craig Duff (duff) to the committee, and welcome back Shane Stacey (isaac702). The committee would also like to thank Lotta Mikkonen (attol) and Paul Bunbury (bunbun) for all their work and dedication while involved with the committee! The position of Public Relations Officer has also become available as Meabh Landers (timelady) has decided to step down. Please contact [committee](mailto:committee@redbrick.dcu.ie) for more information about the position if you’re interested in running!

## “What's the Bright Idea?” Undergraduate Awards

“What’s the Bright Idea” is an event organised by the non-profit awards organisation, The Undergraduate Awards. This event is going to be a celebration of bright, young individuals and their bright ideas. Students can register their Bright Idea online for the chance to win prizes from Ticketmaster before the 30th of November. Entry to the event is free, with guest speakers, food and live music (provided by The Dying Seconds) at the event. The guest speakers are Caroline Casey (founder of Kanchi), Maria Parodi (Deputy Lord Mayor), James Whelton (web'prenure' & social media connoiseur) and David & Stephen Flynn (founders of The Happy Pear). The event will begin at 6:30pm on the 5th of December at the Odessa, and we encourage our members to take part and attend!

## Movie Night

This Tuesday, Redbrick in association with Strange Things will be hosting a movie night! Turn up on Tuesday evening for a showing of the two Tron films, Tron and Tron: Legacy. Come along to Q120 at 6pm for the viewings. Refreshments will be provided!

## Christmas Party

Coming up, the event we’ve all been waiting for! The Christmas party will be an opportunity for members to relax and mingle with Redbrick members and students from other societies. We’ll be telling you more next week, so keep an eye out!

## FOSDEM Trip

There are still places available for the trip to Brussels in February, so if you’re interested in attending FOSDEM, let us know! Email [mak](mailto:mak@redbrick.dcu.ie) to register your interest. Deadline is Tuesday the 29th of November, which means you must have paid the €90 in full and provided us with passport details by then. This is a trip not to be missed!

## Intersocs LAN

On the 10th of December, there will be a LAN hosted in Trinity College. More information to follow, so get your computers ready!

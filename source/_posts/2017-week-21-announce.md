Dear Redbrick friends,

It's now the second week of the new semester or week 21 overall.

In an attempt to fill you with excitement for the coming semester here is
what we have planned:

 <!-- more -->

##Admin Talk: How to Avoid Phishing

- When: Wednesday 8th, 3-4pm
- Where: LG25
- More information here: https://www.facebook.com/events/630149340519458/

Do you want to keep yourself safe online? Are you tired of losing control
of your accounts
and having no idea why?

We talk about some of the known and unknown techniques that hackers use to
gain access to
your account including phishing on unsuspecting victims and unknowingly
giving your password
to hackers and social engineering; giving away too much info to the people
you think you
can trust.

##InterSocs Social

- When: Friday 10th, 6:30-9pm
- Where: The Brew Dock - 1 Amiens Street, Dublin
- More information here: https://www.facebook.com/events/1794062740854987/

For the second year running, come join us along with five other NetSocs
from five other
lesser universities for some food and drinks and no doubt arguing.

##Google #HashCode 2017

- When: Thursday 23rd, 5-9pm
- Where: LG25
- More information here: https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/

Once again, DCU School of Computing will be a Hub for Google's HashCode

February 5-9pm.
Hash Code is open to university students and industry professionals in
Europe, the Middle
East and Africa. Participants compete in teams of two to four.

Registration is free of charge and will close on 20th February 2017 at
17:00 GMT.

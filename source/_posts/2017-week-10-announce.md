## Ball

We would like to thank everyone who came to the ball on Thursday!
We hope you all had a good time and we can now stop spamming you about it!


## Social Engineering For Hacking

Social Engineering - what is it?

Come over to LG26 on Wednesday the 22nd of November at 16:00 to learn how
hackers steal your data, how you hand it over to them regularly, and attacks
they use to break into your accounts and buildings.

If you have an interest in protecting yourself in a modern world come and find
out both the sophisticated techniques, and the not so sophisticated ones too!

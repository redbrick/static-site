## Monday Social Pints

We're having a small get together this week, from 6pm onwards on Monday we'll be having a few pints together in the NuBar. It's a good opportunity to sit down, chill out, and escape assignments and exams for a short while! Keep an eye out for the Redbrick hoodies if you don't recognise anyone!

## Christmas Party

We will be hosting our annual Christmas party in week 11 this year, with a number of wonderful societies! Get your Santa hats, Christmas jumpers and tinsel at the ready, we'll have drink specials, and a very special visit from a man in a red suit... With presents of course! Refreshments will be available on the night, we'll have more information for you all before then!

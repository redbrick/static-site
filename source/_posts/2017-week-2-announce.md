Dear Brickies, old, and new

First of all, we would like to welcome all new members to Redbrick, the best
society in DCU, holding strong since 1996.

## Intro To Redbrick

To get you started with, we have a n00b friendly introduction session into what
Redbrick does, why you should care, and how to connect to Redbrick to be part of the hipster IRC squad. The talk will be held on Wednesday, 2017-09-27 16:00 IST.

## EGM

We are also holding a EGM, as we need to elect a First Year Rep - a proxy between what the first years need and the rest of committee (because we can't understand kids those days). There will be pizza. The EGM would take place in Week 3, on Wed 2017-10-04 17:00

## Renewals

We would also like to remind existing members about importance of renewals and unit tests. You can either renew on the website or send the money by PayPal. Just make sure that you email admins@redbrick.dcu.ie with your transaction code so we can verify.


## Engineering and Computing Ball

The Second ever Engineering and Computing Ball with take place on November 16th in The Bonnington Hotel (formerly Regency Hotel). You can sign up today by throwing 10 euro at a committee member.

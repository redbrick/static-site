The Helpdesk is made up of the friendly team of two Sahil Mehra (pr0n) & Michal Durinik (mikello).

The Helpdesk is what it sounds like, a desk for help. No seriously, we're here
to help out and answer any questions at all to help you make the most of
Redbrick. Don't be shy now, feel free to mail or hey us any time and check out

We also run regular tutorial in the CA labs in DCU, any member can attend and we
will guide you through the basics and answer any queries, watch out for notices
and posters around campus or on Redbrick.
